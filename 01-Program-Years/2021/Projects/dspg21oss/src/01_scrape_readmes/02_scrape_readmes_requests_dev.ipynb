    "### Call Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the `scrape_readmes()` function, you first need to set the username and personal acccess token (PAT) that you create on GitHub. While you can run it without this information but having no PAT means you can only make 50 calls an hour compared to about 5,000. It helps if you have several PATs to help in this process, especially since this function takes only a few moments to make 5,000 calls after the multiprocessing is incorporated. In this pipeline, we are calling the usernames and PATs from a table in PostgreSQL that looks like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "|    login    |   token  | \n",
    "|    :---:    |  :----:  |     \n",
    "|  username1  |   PAT1   | \n",
    "|  username2  |   PAT2   | \n",
    "|  etc.  |   etc.   | \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the username and PAT are passed into the authetication fields, `requests` will connect to the GitHub repository of all the slugs you feed it. We have designed the function to throw errors for all issues it encounters unless it gets a 404 error (i.e. no README available), as this usually means that the repo or README has been deleted, never existed, and/or is no longer available for some reason. Unfortunately, the way that GitHub's API is setup seems to require two calls to get the README: one to get the JSON with the README location and another to decode the content. We have a `@sleep_and_retry` decorator to deal with this if we setup a `slurm` for each PAT, but using it here in the notebook means that you will just want to wait for the threshold to be hit and then move onto the next PAT. While we plan to continue working on this function to minimize the number of calls, this process will allow us to get some preliminary data for classification in the short-term. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this chunk, you will also see the `filter_scraped_readmes()` function that filters scraped READMEs. Basically, you just feed this function your original data and then it filters out slugs that have already been scraped based on the local CSV that has that information. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: Before running this cell, you need to set the** `github_pat_index`. **Changing this parameter provides access to 36 different PATs.** "
