This project, in collaboration with Arlington County, Virginia, examines the landscape of the provision of parks and their amenities in Arlington County from a racial equity lens. Combining data from the American Community Survey, Arlington Open Data Portal, CoreLogic, and scraped web information, we characterize the extent to which Arlington County is providing services that align with various communities’ needs and desires. In addition to racial (and other demographic) breakdowns, we consider other factors that may influence one’s needs for certain amenities such as car ownership, presence of young children, and type of housing (e.g. single family home or apartment building) and their intersections with race. We then calculate isochrones to determine how long residents of each neighborhood must travel to get to various parks and access certain amenities and overlay the factors described above to determine varying levels of access. Lastly, we calculate spatial accessibility to parks and their amenities using the two-step floating catchment area method, which incorporates both the demand and supply for parks and their amenities as catchment areas that overlap.
