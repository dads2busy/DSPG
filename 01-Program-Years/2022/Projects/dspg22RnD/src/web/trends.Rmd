Below are figures showing the top 10, 20, and 30 topics respectively that appear when non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was run on a corpus of documents identified as relating to big data. For these figures, the corpus selected was from the documents identified using TF-IDF and KNN. This model had far less false positives than Doc2Vec and KNN, making it more accurate. 

<!-- When Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) was run on the corpus of documents identified as big data, it was seen that 10 main themes emerged. On the Doc2Vec resutls, it was clear that 6 of the 10 topics clearly relate to health sciences. On the TF-IDF results, 7 of the 10 topics identified were clearly related to health sciences.    -->
<!-- For all of the figures below, the first is using a set of abstracts identified as using big data when using TF-IDF to vectorize the abstracts and KNN to classify them. The second figure in each section uses Doc2vec to vectorize the abstracts and KNN to classify. -->

## 1. NMF with 10 topics  
![](www/bigdata_10topic_trends.png)
The figure shows the 10 main broad research areas using big-data and funded by a federal agency. The research areas cover clinical trial, clinical investigation, health community, brain and neural cognitive, food safety, data analysis, conference, cancer, child and cell.  

>Increasing research areas: clinical trials, clinical investigations, and health communities.  
    
>Declining research areas:cells and statistical analysis 

## 2. NMF with 20 topics   
![](www/bigdata_20topic_trends.png)
We increased the number of topics to have a more granular understanding of the research areas using big data. The result is similar to the 10 topics with some additional research areas emerging on imaging, vaccine, social behavior.  

>Increasing research areas:  clinical trials, patient care and data analysis.  

>Declining research areas: proteins, cells, and lungs.


## 3. NMF with 30 topics   
![](www/bigdata_30topic_trends.png)  

Finally, we expanded the number of topic to 30 in order to have a more large view of topics funded by a federal agency that use big data.  In addition to the research area described with 10 and 20 topics, other research topics that support the use of big data cover drug development, risk intervention, HIV, conferences and meeting, learning language and speech.  

>Increasing research areaas: clinical trials and patient care.  

>Declining research areas: proteins, crops, and cells.


 
<!-- ![](www/doc2vec_model.PNG) -->
<!-- Terms such as datum, model, and system idenify p9 above as a topic that most likely relates new methods in big data. 347,219 documents were selected as a part of this topic group as can be seen by the n value above.  -->

<!-- ## 3. Model Comparission   -->
<!-- Looking at both of the models above, there are many topic groups in health science that utilize big data techniques to conduct their research. There are is also a clear topic that appears that represents abstracts in the corpus that relate directly to big data methods.  -->
