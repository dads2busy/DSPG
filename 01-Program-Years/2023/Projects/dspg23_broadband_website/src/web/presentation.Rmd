## The USDA ReConnect Program
### - Three rounds of funding completed, with the fourth on-going
### - 316 projects approved and $3.86 billion invested since 2019

<br>
<br>

## Three primary goals of 2023 DSPG Summer Project: 

### 1. Improve dataset quality at household level through geocoding and web scraping
### 2. Assess the impact of a completed ReConnect project on internet connection
### 3. Create a workflow that can be scaled nationally and reproduced for future projects

# Methodology: Difference-in-Difference
#### Compare the internet speed of subscribers inside the project area (the treatment group) and comparable households around the project area (the control group) before and after project completion
<br>

## (1) Challenge in matching treatment and control households
### Solution: BlackKnight property dataset
## (2) Challenge in determining internet speed
### Solution: build a predictive model based on subscription data in 2021
<br>

# Geocoding Schema

## Coordinates and addresses are key to linking different datasets and predicting internet speed

# Ookla Imputation

![Map of smoothed Ookla results for the sample project. Greyscale squares are raw Ookla data, chromatic circles are imputed results](img/ookla_fitted.png)
</center>
<br>

### Ookla provides data as the average speed testing result in a 600-by-600 meter tile.
### We applied a Gaussian kernel to impute speed at each propery based on their lat-long.

# A predictive model is estimated using the 2021 data of the ReConnect subscribers

SubscriptionSpeed = \beta_0 + \beta_1ImputedOokla + \beta_2FCCMedAdSpeed + \vec{\beta_i}\vec{HousingFeatures} + e

# Rural Buffer Zone

<img src="img/bufferzone.png" width="500" />
</center>

## To ensure the ReConnect subscrbers (treatment group) are compared to similar communities, we choose the control group only from the project buffer zone, which is
### - the surrounding area within 20 miles of the project
### - belongs to a census tract that is rural, defined by
### - a Rural Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) code at least 7

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Matching treatment group and control group

<br>

![](img/ookla_fitted.png)
</center>
<br>

### We implemented a matching algorithm based on between subscriber and buffer-zone properties on number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, building area, age of building, and 2021 assessed value. Each subscriber is matched to a property with the minimum Mahalanobis distance.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Here presents the difference-in-difference analysis results
$$
PredictedSpeed_{h,t} = \alpha + \beta treatment_h + \gamma year_t + \delta_{DD}treatment_h * year_t + e_{h,t}
$$

## We have strong evidence to believe the implementation of the ReConnect project brings a statistically significant improvement to internet connection in the project area.

# Future Steps
<br>
<br>

## - Evaluate additional sources to supplement Ookla imputation, such as M-Lab.
## - Explore solutions to systematic missing of property info in certain states.
## - Reproduce the analysis as newly completed projects data becomes available.
