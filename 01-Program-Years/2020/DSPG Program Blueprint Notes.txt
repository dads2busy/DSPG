What I've been charged with is coming up with a BluePrint and set of example Resources for other programs to follow/use to establish their own DSPG program. I see this as something we'd share via our DSPG website, as well via a publication of some sort.

As a first step, I will put together an initial outline of each of the stages and attendant responsibilities necessary to launch a DSPG program. I will then reach out to each of you, our partner schools, to each individual that was involved in administering or contributing to each specific area to see if I'm missing anything and how you all did them, undoubtedly better than us in some cases (I'm looking at you Kelsey).

These areas include:
* Recruiting & Selection
* Project Solicitation & Selection
* Faculty Responsibilities & Project Monitoring
* Data Management
* Platform Management
* Training & Speakers
* Mentoring
* Presentations & Symposium
