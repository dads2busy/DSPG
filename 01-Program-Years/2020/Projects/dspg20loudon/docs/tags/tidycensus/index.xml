      <description>Food insecurity may also be affected by food accessibility. Those with access to high quality food outlets were less likely to be food insecure (Mayer, Hillier, Bachhuber and Long, 2014).

Unlike traditional food retailers and farmers’ markets, food pantries usually provide food to vulnerable populations for free or at especially discounted prices.</description>
