04:27:17	Crystal Zang:	Quick question to the previous team, how are you hosting data for the users to access the data from the dspg r package?
04:29:43	Heike Hofmann:	The package is hosted on GitHub for now at: DSPG-ISU/DSPG
04:30:45	Crystal Zang:	Cool. I assume the data sets are not huge, since  GitHub doesn’t  allow large data set
04:31:56	Matthew Voss:	Yeah, none of our data sets so far are particularly large
05:03:26	Brandon Kramer:	Very interesting! Thank you very much.
