01:37:57	Douglas Perry, Pat Co:	Doug Perry from Virginia. I am also working to stop the legalization of marijuana here in Va.  I would love to know how has marijuana effected the communities?
01:38:58	joannaschroeder:	Hi Doug, I’m from the Wasco team. This isn’t something our stakeholders have emphasized as being an issue for the region, but I can ask.
01:40:56	Mary Solomon:	^^^ yes marijuana and drug use has not been in the scope of our project so far. But that’s a great question! I think it would be something insightful for us to look into. Thank you for asking!
01:52:38	Douglas Perry, Pat Co:	the food data and Google maps, isn’t reality. many of those convenance stores aren’t so much for food. or “junk” type of food.

03:18:12	joannaschroeder:	For eviction team, have you all looked into any data about access to civil legal aid? I know a lot of like 90% tenants have to represent themselves legally in eviction cases, so access to civil legal help may predict eviction rate
