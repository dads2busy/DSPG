WHILE THE ORIGINAL 1U FORM FACTOR WAS SEEN TO BE TOO SMALL FOR USEFUL APPLICATIONS THE 3U FORM FACTOR HAS GROWN IN POPULARITY AND THE RECENT SUCCESS OF SPACE SCIENCE CUBESAT MISSIONS SUCH AS RAX DICE AND CSSWE HAVE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE CAPABILITY OF THESE PLATFORMS FOR SCIENTIFIC MISSIONS. WITH A RECENT PUSH FROM NASA AND OTHERS IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE NEW 6U FORM FACTOR WILL OPEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO FLY MORE CAPABLE SCIENTIFIC PAYLOADS THAT SIMPLY WOULD NOT FIT INTO THE MASS AND VOLUME CONSTRAINTS OF THE 3U FORM FACTOR. IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE CUBESAT STANDARD DEVELOPMENTS IN SUBSYSTEM TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO BEEN MOVING THE CAPABILITIES OF THESE SYSTEMS FORWARD. SUCH DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE DEPLOYABLE SOLAR ARRAYS AND SUB ARCMINUTE ATTITUDE CONTROL AND DETERMINATION SYSTEMS. HOWEVER ONE OF THE CURRENT BOTTLENECKS IN SMALL SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY IS THE AVAILABILITY OF A COST EFFECTIVE  LOW POWER COMMUNICATION SYSTEM THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE CUBESAT STANDARD AND CAN ACHIEVE DATA RATES OF 12.5MBPS OR MORE. WE ARE PROPOSING TO DEVELOP A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WITH AN S-BAND COMMAND UPLINK AND AN XBAND DATA DOWNLINK CAPABLE OF 12.5MBPS AND COMPATIBLE WITH THE MASS VOLUME AND POWER CONSTRAINTS OF A CUBESAT. ADDITIONALLY THE SYSTEM WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE NASA NEAR EARTH NETWORK WHICH IS USED FOR COMMUNICATING WITH SATELLITES IN EARTH ORBIT. THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO LABORATORY OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SPACE PHYSICS LASP HAS BEEN DEVELOPING AN XBAND TRANSMITTER CAPABILITY AS PART OF AN INTERNAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IR&D PROJECT SINCE JANUARY. THE SYSTEM DESIGN HAS BEEN VERIFIED AND ELEMENTS OF THE SYSTEM HAVE BEEN BENCH TESTED. SIMILARLY RESEARCHERS AT THE NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER GSFC HAVE DESIGNED AN S-BAND RECEIVER SUITABLE FOR COMMAND UPLINK. BOTH OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE SOLIDLY AT A TRL3 AND OUR GOAL THROUGH THIS PROGRAM IS TO INCREASE THE HARDWARE TO TRL5. ADDITIONALLY THE SBAND RECEIVER WILL BE DESIGNED SUCH THAT WITH THE INCLUSION OF A SECOND MIXER STAGE THIS RECEIVER WOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH OUR XBAND TRANSMITTER THUS ENABLING AN XBAND SATELLITE CROSSLINK. GSFC IS DEVELOPING CUBESAT TECHNOLOGY AND IS CURRENTLY PROVIDING ADVISORY AND TESTING SUPPORT ON THE X-BAND TRANSMITTER DESIGN AS THEY ARE KEENLY INTERESTED IN THE OUTCOME. GSFC HAS DONE SIMILAR WORK INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION AND TEST OF A CUSTOM S-BAND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM. THIS EFFORT IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AND NASA GSFC WHERE WE INTEND TO INTEGRATE THE GSFC DESIGN IN PART OR WHOLE AS A BASIS FOR THE RECEIVER PORTION OF THE OVERALL COMMUNICATIONS ARCHITECTURE. THE PI ON THIS PROPOSAL IS A FACULTY MEMBER IN THE AEROSPACE ENGINEERING SCIENCES DEPARTMENT WITH A COURTESY APPOINTMENT IN THE ELECTRICAL  COMPUTER AND ENERGY DEPARTMENT. HE HAS A DECADE OF EXPERIENCE DIRECTING ENGINEERING PROJECTS BASED LEARNING COURSES AND IS COI ON THE COLORADO STUDENT SPACE WEATHER SATELLITE CSSWE CUBESAT  A PROJECT THAT INVOLVED OVER 60 STUDENTS. ON THIS PROJECT WE EXPECT TO ENGAGE A GROUP OF SENIOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS WITH THE S-BAND RECEIVER DESIGN AND WORK WITH A GROUP OF CURRENT AEROSPACE ENGINEERING STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM ACCOMMODATION ISSUES FOR THE NEW CUBESAT RADIO. FINALLY  BLUE CANYON TECHNOLOGIES  A SMALL BUSINESS WORKING TO DEVELOP CUBESAT BUS TECHNOLOGIES IS AN UNFUNDED PARTNER ON THIS PROJECT AND HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN LICENSING THE RADIO THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING AND PROVIDING IT IN THEIR PRODUCT LINE.,NON,,6,,2,,2017-02-06 00:00:00+00

RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST THAT EVEN SMALL CHANGES IN STRATOSPHERIC HUMIDITY MAY HAVE CLIMATE IMPACTS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THOSE OF DECADAL INCREASES IN GREENHOUSE GASES. FUTURE CHANGES IN STRATOSPHERIC HUMIDITY AND OZONE CONCENTRATION IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING CLIMATE ARE SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE FEEDBACKS. WHILE THE TROPOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR CLIMATE FEEDBACK IS WELL REPRESENTED IN GLOBAL MODELS  PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE CHANGES IN STRATOSPHERIC HUMIDITY ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BECAUSE OF GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICAL PROCESSES OCCURRING IN THE TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE LAYER (TTL  -13-18 KM)  THE REGION OF THE ATMOSPHERE THAT CONTROLS THE COMPOSITION OF THE STRATOSPHERE. UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TTL CHEMICAL COMPOSITION ALSO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT FUTURE CHANGES IN STRATOSPHERIC OZONE. WE PROPOSE A SERIES OF MEASUREMENT CAMPAIGNS USING THE LONG-RANGE NASA GLOBAL HAWK. (GH) UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM (UAS) TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS.A NUMBER OF TIL PROCESSES AFFECT STRATOSPHERIC HUMIDITY AND OZONE: DEEP CONVECTIVE TRANSPORT OF WATER VAPOR AND OTHER CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS INTO THE TTL; THE FORMATION OF UBIQUITOUS THIN CIRRUS IN THE TTL (WHICH THEMSELVES HAVE A LARGE EFFECT ON THE RADIATION BUDGET AND CLIMATE); LIMITATION OF STRATOSPHERIC HUMIDITY BY SEDIMENTING ICE CRYSTALS IN TTL THIN CIRRUS; SLOW VERTICAL TRANSPORT THROUGH THE TTL; THE EFFECTS OF TROPICAL ATMOSPHERIC WAVES ON TTL THERMAL STRUCTURE  DEHYDRATION  AND TRANSPORT; AND THE CHEMISTRY OF SHORT-LIVED TRACE GASES.OBSERVATIONS OF TTL COMPOSITION ARE SPARSE COMPARED TO THOSE IN OTHER CLIMATICALLY IMPORTANT REGIONS  PARTLY BECAUSE THE HIGH TTL ALTITUDE LIMITS AIRCRAFT SAMPLING. FURTHER  THE UTILITY OF SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS OF TTL COMPOSITION IS REDUCED BY THE CHARACTERISTICALLY STRONG VERTICAL GRADIENTS IN THE TTL. AS A RESULT  TTL PROCESSES ARE NOT WELL REPRESENTED IN GLOBAL MODELS. THIS INVESTIGATION WILL PROVIDE DATA NEEDED TO ADDRESS THESE SHORTCOMINGS: HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION (ONLY OBTAINABLE BY AIRCRAFT) MEASUREMENTS OVER LARGE GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS (REQUIRING THE GR RANGE) AND OVER MULTIPLE SEASONS.THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION FILLS SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE IDENTIFIED IN THE NASA DECADAL SURVEY INVOLVING CLIMATE CHANGE  STRATOSPHERIC OZONE  AND STRATOSPHERE-TROPOSPHERE EXCHANGE. SCIENCE QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:1. WHAT PROCESSES CONTROL THE TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE TEMPERATURE AND THE HUMIDITY OF AIR ENTERING THE STRATOSPHERE (INCLUDING THEIR SEASONAL CYCLES)?2. WHAT ARE THE DOMINANT PATHWAYS FOR VERTICAL TRANSPORT FROM CONVECTIVE DETRAINMENT ALTITUDES IN THE TTL UP TO THE TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE IN DIFFERENT SEASONS?3. WHAT ARE THE FORMATION PROCESSES  MICROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES  AND CLIMATE IMPACT OF TTL CIRRUS  AND HOW DO THESE CLOUDS REGULATE THE HUMIDITY OF AIR ENTERING THE STRATOSPHERE?4. WHAT ARE THE CHEMICAL AND TRANSPORT PROCESSES THAT DRIVE THE BUDGETS OF PRECURSORS OF OZONE-DESTROYING SUBSTANCES SUCH AS SHORT-LIVED HALOGEN COMPOUNDS?5. HOW WILL TTL CIRRUS  STRATOSPHERIC HUMIDITY  AND STRATOSPHERIC OZONE RESPOND TO A CHANGING CLIMATE  AND WHAT ARE THE RESULTING FEEDBACK EFFECTS?,NON,,20,,2,,2017-06-20 00:00:00+00

IN THAT PROJECT  DETAILED MEASUREMENTS WERE ACQUIRED ON THE PURDUE THREE-STAGE AXIAL RESEARCH COMPRESSOR FOR 3 ROTOR TIP CLEARANCES: 1.5%  3%  AND 4% (BASED ON SPAN).

AS NASA RESEARCHERS HAVE USED THE DATA TO RUN CFD SIMULATIONS  IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT BETTER DEFINITION OF THE LEAKAGE UNDER THE KNIFE SEALS OF STATOR 1 AND STATOR 2 ARE REQUIRED TO GET THE RIGHT STAGE MATCHING IN THE SIMULATIONS. THUS  DATA WILL BE ACQUIRED TO QUANTIFY THE LEAKAGE FLOW THROUGH THE KNIFE SEALS. ALSO  ADDITIONAL DETAILED MEASUREMENTS OF THE TOTAL PRESSURE FIELD WILL BE ACQUIRED AT 3% CLEARANCE SO THAT PARAMETERS SUCH AS TIP LEAKAGE VORTEX SIZE AND PENETRATION CAN BE STUDIED AND COMPARED TO PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED RESULTS FOR THE 1.5% AND 4% CLEARANCE CONFIGURATIONS.

THIS PROPERTY  AS WELL AS THEIR VERY LIGHT THERMAL MASS  MAKES THEM IDEAL ABSORBERS FOR RADIATION MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS. HEREIN WE DESCRIBE A DEMONSTRATION OF VACNT-BASED RADIOMETER TECHNOLOGY TO BE CARRIED ON A COMMERCIAL SUBORBITAL REUSABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE (SRLV). THE RESULTS OF THIS PROPOSED WORK AND DEMONSTRATION WOULD RAISE THE TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL (TRL) OF THIS TECHNOLOGY FROM 3 TO 7 ENABLING THEIR PROPOSED USE IN FUTURE NASA AND OPERATIONAL EARTH SCIENCE MISSIONS. WHILE THIS EFFORT IS FOCUSED ON THE SPACE QUALIFICATION AND DEMONSTRATION OF VACNTS FOR RADIATION REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS  SUCCESSFUL QUALIFICATION FURTHER ADVANCES THEIR USE FOR THE MYRIAD OF HOPEFUL APPLICATIONS OUTLINED IN THE NASA TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP [2012] NANOTECHOLOGY AREA (TA10). WE ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO PURSUE THIS PARTICULAR APPLICATION OF VACNTS  BECAUSE TWO ADVANCEMENTS ARE NEEDED TO MEASURE THE ABSOLUTE RADIATION IMBALANCE THOUGHT TO DRIVE CLIMATE CHANGE: A MINIMUM OF 20-30 WIDE FIELD OF VIEW RADIOMETER CONTINUOUSLY ENCIRCLING THE GLOBE AND AFFORDABLE-HIGHLY ACCURATE RADIOMETERS. CUBE-SATS AND HOSTED PAYLOAD OPPORTUNITIES HAVE NOW MADE FIRST REQUIREMENT RECENTLY AFFORDABLE; WE BELIEVE VACNT MAKE THE SECOND REQUIREMENT AFFORDABLE. VACNT BASED BOLOMETER RADIOMETERS PROVIDE JUST THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED TO MAKE EARTH AND SUN OBSERVING RADIOMETERS SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE AND LOW COST TO MEASURE S EARTH S ABSOLUTE ENERGY BALANCE/IMBALANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. THIS IS PRECISELY THE MEASUREMENT THAT IS NEEDED TO RESOLVE THE CLIMATE CHANGE DEBATE AND ENABLE VASTLY SUPERIOR PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE CHANGE. THE PROPOSAL TEAM INCLUDES ALL THE CRITICAL EXPERIENCE TO MAKE THIS DEMONSTRATION A SUCCESS. H. DR. TODD SMITH  THE PI HAS PIONEERED EFFORTS IN USING COMMERCIAL SRLVS FOR SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION. DR.

THE MANY CAVES  CANYONS  AND PITS THAT COVER THE SURFACE OF MARS AND THE MOON HAVE IMMENSE SCIENTIFIC VALUE  YET THE RUGGED TERRAIN AND PRECIPITOUS SLOPES OF THESE FEATURES ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO RISK THE PRIMARY MISSION ASSET. THE SOLUTION TO THIS RISK PROBLEM IS A SYMBIOTIC ARCHITECTURE CONSISTING OF A PRIMARY ROVER AND ONE OR MORE SECONDARY COMPANION ROVERS. THESE SECONDARY ROVERS WOULD BE LESS EXPENSIVE  POTENTIALLY EXPENDABLE  AND CAPABLE OF EXPLORING HAZARDOUS TERRAIN AND FEATURES WITHOUT RISKING THE MISSION IF LOST. THE BENEFITS OF A SYMBIOTIC ARCHITECTURE EXTEND FAR BEYOND SIMPLE RISK MITIGATION  THE SECONDARY ROVERS COULD EXPLORE MORE AREA EFFICIENTLY  PROVIDE OPERATORS WITH ADDITIONAL VIEWPOINTS OF OBJECTS OF INTEREST  AND ASSIST OPERATORS IN DEBUGGING PROBLEMS WITH THE PRIMARY ROVER BY PROVIDING VIEWS THAT WOULD BE OTHERWISE IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE. THOUGH SYMBIOTIC MULTI ROBOT SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED  FEW HAVE BEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF HAZARDOUS PLANETARY EXPLORATION. THOSE THAT HAVE  FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE MECHANICAL CHALLENGES OF SUCH A SYSTEM. THERE ARE MULTIPLE ALGORITHMIC CHALLENGES RELATING TO COORDINATION BETWEEN THE ROVERS THAT ARE BARRIERS TO A SYMBIOTIC ROVER ARCHITECTURE BEING REALIZED. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ALLOW SYMBIOTIC ROVER TEAMS TO BETTER NAVIGATE AND EXPLORE HAZARDOUS TERRAIN BY DEVELOPING AND APPLYING INNOVATIVE METHODS IN COMBINED PATH PLANNING  TASK ALLOCATION  AND LOCALIZATION. THE ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED BY THIS RESEARCH WILL ENABLE SYMBIOTIC ROVERS TO BOLDLY EXPLORE SCIENTIFIC FRONTIERS CURRENTLY CONSIDERED BEYOND LIMITS BY NASA. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL IMPROVE CURRENT DISTANCE AND TIME CONSTRAINED MULTI ROBOT PATH PLANNING ALGORITHMS BY SHIFTING THE CONSTRAINTS FROM THE TIME DOMAIN TO RESOURCE COST DOMAIN. THIS WILL ALLOW THE SECONDARY ROVER WITH MORE LIMITED RESOURCES ENERGY SAMPLE STORAGE  ETC TO RENDEZVOUS WITH THE PRIMARY ROVER BEFORE THE RESOURCE IS EXPENDED. INITIAL EXPERIMENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM WILL BE DONE IN SIMULATION BY AUTOMATICALLY GENERATING THE HAZARD MAPS AND VERIFYING THE OPTIMALITY OF THE GENERATED PATHS. IF THEY ARE CONSISTENTLY SUCCESSFUL  THE METHODS AND ALGORITHMS WILL BE TESTED IN THE FIELD WITH MOBILE ROBOTS.,NON,,O,,2,,2017-10-18 20:04:16.497524+00

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SCALE AND INTENSITY OF BLOWDOWN DISTURBANCE UPON REGIONAL FOREST CARBON DYNAMICS HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF CONTENTION IN RECENT STUDIES  AND MOST EFFORT TOWARDS QUANTIFYING THE NATURAL DISTURBANCE REGIME OF THE AMAZON BASIN HAS BEEN FOCUSED UPON SHORT TIME PERIODS IN THE CENTRAL AMAZON  DESPITE THE GREATER BLOWDOWN-GENERATING RAINFALL  AND FASTER RATE OF FOREST TURNOVER EXPERIENCED IN THE EXTREMELY CARBON DENSE NORTHWESTERN AMAZON. TO DATE  NO ESTIMATE OF THE FREQUENCY FOR DIFFERENT BLOWDOWN SIZE CLASSES HAS BEEN PUBLISHED FOR THE NORTHWESTERN AMAZON. THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER IN THE REGION LIMITS USEFUL LANDSAT IMAGE ACQUISITION  WHICH HAS BEEN THE DOMINANT DATA SOURCE TO TRACK BLOWDOWNS. ALTERNATIVELY  THE MODIS PLATFORM GENERATES DATA WITH A HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION  BUT A METHOD TO DETECT BLOWDOWN DISTURBANCES FROM COARSER RESOLUTION IMAGES NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED. HERE  I PROPOSE TO USE MULTI-SENSOR DATA-FUSION THAT WILL COMBINE A 30-M LANDSAT FOREST DELINEATION MAP WITH 500-M MODIS SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE DATA TO PRODUCE A DOWNSCALED 30-M MODIS INTERPOLATION.

THE DOWNSCALED TIME SERIES IMAGERY WILL BE COMPARED WITH A KNOWN DISTURBANCE RECORD FROM THE LANDSAT IMAGES TO TEST FOR THE MODIS DATA RECORD S ACCURACY AND MINIMUM THRESHOLD FOR DETECTING BLOWDOWN DISTURBANCES. THE METHODOLOGY WILL BE APPLIED TO 2001-2011 MODIS DATA RECORD TO QUANTIFY THE SUBREGIONAL SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF BLOWDOWN DISTURBANCE EVENTS ACROSS THENORTHWESTERN AMAZON. BLOWDOWN SIZE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS  CALCULATED FROM THE MODIS DATA  WILL BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH FIELD-DERIVED FOREST DEMOGRAPHIC AND STRUCTURAL DATA TO PARAMETERIZE A PREVIOUS-EXISTING FOREST BIOMASS SIMULATION MODEL (TRECOS) TO ESTIMATE ABOVEGROUND FOREST CARBON LOSS FROM BLOWDOWN DISTURBANCES.

AS A STATEWIDE MEMBER-SUPPORTED ORGANIZATION, OASHF IS THE LARGEST CHARITABLE FOOD ASSISTANCE NETWORK IN OHIO.   IN STATE FISCAL YEAR 2010, OASHF AND ITS NETWORK OF 12 FEEDING AMERICA-AFFILIATED FOODBANKS, DISTRIBUTED NEARLY 35 MILLION POUNDS OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND SHELF-STABLE ITEMS THROUGH OASHF'S TWO CORE PROGRAMS: THE OHIO FOOD PROGRAM AND THE AGRICULTURE CLEARANCE PROGRAM, AN INCREASE OF 41.6% OVER THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR.  THESE TWO STATE-FUNDED PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC-PRIVATE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE, NOT ONLY FEEDING HUNGRY OHIOANS, BUT HELPING LOCAL FARMERS, GROWERS AND COMMODITY PRODUCERS BY CLEARING THEIR UNMARKETABLE -- THOUGH INCREDIBLY WHOLESOME -- PRODUCTS AND DISTRIBUTING THEM THROUGH A NETWORK OF OVER 3,000 FOOD PANTRIES, SOUP KITCHENS AND OTHER EMERGENCY FOOD PROVIDERS.  

RECOGNIZING THAT HUNGER IS MERELY A SYMPTOM OF POVERTY, OASHF CONTINUES TO BE THE HOME OF THE OHIO BENEFIT BANK (OBB), A TECHNOLOGY-BASED MOVEMENT TO CONNECT POOR OHIOANS TO THE CRITICAL WORK SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND TAX CREDITS, INCLUDING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT.  SINCE LAUNCHING THE OHIO BENEFIT BANK IN JULY, 2006, WITH NINE AMERICORPS VISTA MEMBERS AS THE BACKBONE OF THE EFFORT, THE OBB HAS CONNECTED OVER 116,000 STRUGGLING OHIO HOUSEHOLDS -- OVER 181,000 INDIVIDUALS -- TO OVER $400 MILLION IN TAX CREDITS AND WORK SUPPORTS.

OASHF CONTINUES TO ENJOY A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE (CNCS), FUNCTIONING AS A STATEWIDE INTERMEDIARY SPONSOR.  THIS MODEL CREATES GREAT EFFICIENCIES WITHIN CNCS BY PROVIDING A BLOCK OF SLOTS TO OASHF TO SUB-GRANT OUT TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WITH A MISSION TO COMBAT POVERTY.  OASHF HAS MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE MANAGING LARGE, STATEWIDE PROGRAMS, SO THIS MODEL HAS WORKED VERY WELL IN PREVIOUS YEARS. 

IN ORDER TO MEET THE EVER-RISING DEMAND ON THE EMERGENCY FOOD NETWORK AND THE PUBLIC BENEFITS SYSTEMS, AND TO CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AS AN INTERMEDIARY SPONSOR, OASHF RESPECTFULLY REQUESTS A SECOND YEAR OF OPERATIONAL GRANT FUNDING FOR SHARECORPS (SECOND HARVEST AMERICORPS VISTA RESOURCE AND ENGAGEMENT CORPS), TO BEGIN ON APRIL, 24, 2011.  OASHF REQUESTS A CONTINUATION GRANT TO SUPPORT A TOTAL OF 72 VISTA MEMBER SLOTS AND 3 VISTA LEADER SLOTS, WITH OASHF COST-SHARING 20 MEMBER SLOTS.  AS IN THE CURRENT PROGRAM YEAR, OASHF WILL ALLOCATE ROUGHLY HALF OF THE NON-LEADER SLOTS TO BE RELEASED TO ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE OF OASHF'S NETWORK THROUGH AN RFP PROCESS.  CURRENTLY, OASHF HAS PLACED MEMBERS AT NEARLY 30 ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT OHIO THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY MODEL.  PROGRAM STAFF IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING EACH SITE AND EXPECT THAT AT LEAST NINE HOST SITES WILL NOT CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT PROGRAM YEAR.  ALL OTHER HOST SITES IN GOOD STANDING WILL REAPPLY TO RETAIN THEIR SLOT THROUGH A SHORT, ONE PAGE REQUEST.  OASHF WILL CONTINUE TO ASSIGN APPROXIMATELY 30 MEMBER SLOTS TO CONTINUE THE ANTI-HUNGER WORK AT FOOD BANKS AS WELL AS TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE OHIO BENEFIT BANK IN INNOVATIVE AND NEW WAYS.  

IN JANUARY, 2011, OASHF SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL TO CNCS TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM BY AT LEAST TEN MEMBER SLOTS TO CREATE A SMALL CORPS TO WORK ON CONNECTING RETURNING VETERANS TO TRAINING AND EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL HELP THEM TRANSITION TO THE CIVILIAN WORKFORCE.  THIS CORPS WOULD ALSO WORK ON CONNECTING THE FAMILIES OF ACTIVE-DUTY SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN TO CRITICAL PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS.  WHILE THE EXPANSION WAS NOT APPROVED, OASHF IS STILL COMMITTED TO THIS EFFORT AND WILL ALLOCATE UP TO TEN MEMBER SLOTS TO BE SUB-GRANTED THROUGH A LIMITED RFP TARGETED TO VETERAN'S ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE FIVE REGIONAL MILITARY ONE SOURCE OFFICES WHICH OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF PROGRAMMING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES.

BASED ON HOW THESE SPECTRAL AND TIMING PROPERTIES CORRELATE  THREE MAIN SUBCLASSES OF THE PERSISTENTLY BRIGHT NS-LMXBS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED: THE ATOLL  SOURCES  THE SCO-LIKE Z SOURCES  AND THE CYG-LIKE Z SOURCES. WHILE IT HAD LONG BEEN CLEAR THAT THE Z SOURCES ARE CONSIDERABLY MORE LUMINOUS THAN THE ATOLL SOURCES  AND HENCE ACCRETE AT MUCH HIGHER MASS ACCRETION RATES  THE RELATIVE LUMINOSITIES OF THE TWO Z SOURCE SUBCLASSES WERE NOT KNOWN. MOREOVER  THE NATURE OF THE SPECTRAL EVOLUTION ALONG THE TRACKS TRACED OUT BY Z SOURCES REMAINS A MYSTERY. PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH PAST ATTEMPTS TO MODEL THE Z SOURCE SPECTRA IS THE FACT THAT THE BROAD ENERGY COVERAGE OF THESE MISSIONS WAS PROVIDED BY TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS  INSTEAD OF A SINGLE ONE. AS A RESULT OF THIS  THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE SPECTRA SUFFERED FROM CALIBRATION UNCERTAINTIES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS. IN PRACTICE THIS LED TO POOR CONSTRAINTS IN THE HIGH ENERGY COMPONENTS IN THE SPECTRA. NUSTAR FOR THE FIRST TIME PROVIDES BROAD ENERGY COVERAGE FROM SINGLE INSTRUMENT (OR  TO BE PRECISE TWO NEARLY IDENTICALDETECTORS)  THEREBY REMOVING AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE MODELING OF NS-LMXB SPECTRA. ADDITIONALLY  NUSTAR IS MUCH MORE SENSITIVE THAN THE AFOREMENTIONED SATELLITES AT HIGH ENERGIES. WE PROPOSE THREE SHORT (25 KS) OBSERVATIONS OF THE CYG-LIKE Z SOURCE GX 5-1 WITH THE AIM OF BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE SUPER-EDDINGTON ACCRETION FLOWS ONTO NEUTRON STARS. THE GOAL OF OUR OBSERVATIONS IS TO TEST PROPOSED MODELS FOR THE SPECTRAL EVOLUTION IN THIS TYPE OF SOURCE  BY SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSTRAINING THE CONTINUUM AND REFLECTION FEATURES (IN PARTICULAR THE FE LINE) IN THE SPECTRUM. NUSTAR IS UNIQUELY CAPABLE OF DOING SO. BY OBSERVING GX 5-1 WE COMPLETE NUSTAR'S COVERAGE OF NEUTRON-STAR LOW-MASS X-RAY BINARIES ACROSS THE ENTIRE LUMINOSITY RANGE OF THIS CLASS  ALLOWING FOR A DETAILED COMPARISON BETWEEN SUBCLASSES. DATA WILL BE ANALYZED WITH THE STANDARD NUSTAR FTOOLS. OUR ANALYSIS WILL START WITH THE CREATION OF A HARDNESS-INTENSITY DIAGRAM (IN WHICH THE BRANCHES ARE BETTER SEPARATED THAN IN A COLOR-COLOR DIAGRAM). THIS WILL SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR SPECTRAL EXTRACTION. SPECTRA WILL THEN BE EXTRACTED FROM DIFFERENT POSITION ALONG THE Z TRACK AND THESE SPECTRA WILL BE ANALYZED USING VARIOUS SPECTRAL MODELS.

SUCH INFORMATION ALLOWS US TO DETERMINE THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTS TO WHICH THESE PARTICLES WERE EXPOSED AND HOW LONG THEY RESIDED IN EACH. THIS MONTE CARLO MODEL WILL BE MERGED WITH CHEMICAL MODELS TO UNDERSTAND HOW CONDENSATION EVAPORATION  ANNEALING AMORPHIZATION  INTERNAL DIFFUSION  AND IRRADIATION WOULD HAVE DETERMINED THE PROPERTIES OF PRIMITIVE MATERIALS OVER THEIR LIFETIMES IN THE SOLAR NEBULA. WE WILL APPLY THESE MODELS SPECIFICALLY TO PROBLEMS FOR WHICH LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE YIELDED BOTH A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHEMICAL PROCESSING THAT OCCURS UNDER NEBULA CONDITIONS AS WELL AS THOSE FOR WHICH WE HAVE DETAILED CONSTRAINTS FROM METEORITIC AND COMETARY STUDIES. THESE INCLUDE: 1 THE THERMAL PROCESSING OF CALCIUM-ALUMINUM RICH INCLUSIONS AND THE RESULTING ELEMENTAL AND ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATIONS AS WELL AS THE ZONING OF DIFFERENT MINERALS. 2 THE FORMATION OF ORGANIC MOLECULES THROUGH IRRADIATION AND WARMING OF ICES. AND 3 THE COMPETING EFFECTS OF ANNEALING OF SILICATE GRAINS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES AND THE AMORPHIZATION DUE TO EXPOSURE AT THE SURFACE OF THE DISK TO HIGH ENERGY IONS FROM FLARES FROM THE YOUNG SUN. BY CARRYING OUT A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF POSSIBLE SOLAR NEBULA STRUCTURES AND EVOLUTIONARY PARAMETERS  WE WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE CHEMICAL  MINERALOGICAL  AND ISOTOPIC OF METEORITIC AND COMETARY SAMPLES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR FORMATION IN A TURBULENT VISCOUS DISK.

TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL  THREE-COMPONENT LASER DOPPLER VELOCIMETRY (LDV) AND HIGH-RESOLUTION 3-D STEREOSCOPIC AND STANDARD PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY (PIV) MEASUREMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED TO CAPTURE THE VELOCITY FIELD NEAR THE LINER SURFACE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA GRAZING FLOW INCIDENCE IMPEDANCE DUCT (DONATED TO UF BY NASA-LANGLEY) FOR A VARIETY OF LINER DESIGN AND FLOW CONDITIONS. THESE MEASUREMENTS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE GLOBAL FLOW PHYSICS OF THE LINER AS WILL BE USED WITH STATIC PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS TO ESTIMATE THE LINER SKIN FRICTION VIA CONTROL VOLUME ANALYSIS. COMPLEMENTARY TO LDV AND PIV MEASUREMENTS  WE WILL ADAPT TWO DIFFERENT MICROMACHINED TRANSDUCER TECHNOLOGIES TO MAKE SHEAR STRESS MEASUREMENTS ON THE LINER SURFACE. THE FIRST SENSOR IS A DIFFERENTIAL CAPACITIVE FLOATING ELEMENT TRANSDUCER THAT WILL PROVIDE TIME-RESOLVED SHEAR STRESS DATA AT A SINGLE POINT. THE SECOND TRANSDUCER IS A VARIATION OF THE MICROPILLAR SENSORS THAT WILL PROVIDE FULL-FIELD SHEAR STRESS MEASUREMENTS OVER A FEW LINER CELLS AT AN INSTANT IN TIME. BOTH THE FLOW FIELD AND SHEAR STRESS MEASUREMENTS WILL BE MADE SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH STANDARD ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE EDUCTION MEASUREMENTS.

CURRENT CONSTRAINTS OF REIONIZATION FROM OBSERVATIONS OF COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND AND HIGH-REDSHIFT QUASARS POINT TO A RAPID CHANGE OF THE IONIZATION STATE OF THE UNIVERSE FROM REDSHIFT AROUND 10 TO REDSHIFT ABOUT 6. THE CRUCIAL STAGE OF REIONIZATION BETWEEN THE TWO REDSHIFTS AND THE FORMATION OF FIRST GALAXIES ARE CLOSELY LINKED TO EACH OTHER. OBSERVATIONS OF GALAXIES BEYOND REDSHIFT 6  WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAJOR EFFORTS OF THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE (HST) AND ONE OF THE MAIN SCIENCE GOALS OF THE UPCOMING JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (JWST)  CAN PROVIDE CRITICAL DATA FOR LEARNING ABOUT COSMIC REIONIZATION. WE PROPOSE A THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL INVESTIGATION TO USE LYMAN-ALPHA EMITTING GALAXIES (LAES)  WHICH CAN BE EFFICIENTLY DETECTED BEYOND REDSHIFT 6 THROUGH NARROW-BAND IMAGING  TO CONSTRAIN THE LATE STAGE OF REIONIZATION. THE LYMAN-ALPHA PHOTONS EMITTED FROM THESE GALAXIES INTERACT WITH THE CIRCUMGALACTIC AND INTERGALACTIC MEDIA  MAKING THE LYMAN-ALPHA EMISSION A SENSITIVE PROBE OF THE REIONIZATION STATE. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL COMBINE A STATE-OF-THE-ART COSMOLOGICAL REIONIZATION SIMULATION WITH AN EFFICIENT MONTE CARLO LYMAN-ALPHA RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODE TO OBTAIN DETAILED AND REALISTIC LYMAN-ALPHA EMISSION PROPERTIES OF LAES IN A LARGE SURVEY-LIKE VOLUME. OUR PRIMARY SCIENCE GOALS INCLUDE (1) STUDYING AND DESIGNING A VARIETY OF STATISTICS OF LAES TO ADDRESS HOW TO USE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OBSERVED LAES TO PROBE COSMIC REIONIZATION; (2) IMPLEMENTING SEVERAL PRESCRIPTIONS OF GALACTIC WINDS AND INCORPORATING DUST EFFECT TO ADDRESS THE MAJOR UNCERTAINTIES IN THE VISIBILITY OF LAES DURING REIONIZATION; (3) MAKING SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS AND FORMING MOCK LAE OBSERVATIONS TO HELP DEVELOPING OBSERVATIONAL STRATEGIES AND GUIDING OBSERVATIONAL EFFORTS. THE PROPOSED COMPREHENSIVE LYMAN-ALPHA RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELING OF STAR-FORMING GALAXIES IN A COSMOLOGICAL VOLUME ACROSS THE REIONIZATION EPOCH WILL PROVIDE A SOLID THEORETICAL BASIS TO INTERPRET OBSERVATIONS AND TO CONSTRAIN COSMIC REIONIZATION  ADVANCING OUR UNDERSTANDING AND MODELING OF EARLY STRUCTURE FORMATION IN THE UNIVERSE. IT WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO NASA'S CURRENT AND FUTURE SPACE MISSIONS (E.G.  HST AND JWST)  AS WELL AS LARGE GROUND-BASED FACILITIES AND SURVEYS.

THE WORK CONSISTS OF CONNECTING OBSERVATIONS AND MODELING OF THE LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION TO THE DETAILED PROCESSES AT THE ICE SHEET-OCEAN INTERFACE. AT THE HEART OF THE MODELING ARE THE MIT OCEAN GENERAL CIRCULATION MODEL (MITGCM)  JPL&UCI'S ICESHEET SYSTEM MODEL (ISSM)  AND THE STATE ESTIMATION INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPED BY THE NASA-FUNDED ""ESTIMATING THE CIRCULATION AND CLIMATE OF THE OCEAN"" (ECCO) CONSORTIUM. VARIOUS SATELLITE DATA ALREADY USED IN ECCO AND ISSM  NEW DATA BECOMING AVAILABLE THROUGH NASA'S OPERATION ICEBRIDGE  TOGETHER WITH DEDICATED IN-SITU OBSERVATIONS NEAR GREENLAND WILL BE USED FOR AN IMPROVED SYNTHESIS  AND WILL BE LINKED TO DETAILED PROCESS STUDIES. THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS ARE BEING PROPOSED: 1. LARGE-SCALE MODEL-DATA SYNTHESES OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN AND SUBPOLAR GYRE THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED WITHIN ECCO SERVE AS A BASELINE TO ASSESS DECADAL VARIABILITY OF GREENLAND-BOUND SOURCE WATERS; EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON ASSESSING THE SKILL OF THE ESTIMATES IN TERMSOF RESIDUAL MISFITS TO SATELLITE AND IN-SITU (PRESENT AND HISTORICAL) OBSERVATIONS NEAR THE GRIS.  2.

ATMOSPHERIC REANALYSIS PRODUCTS PROVIDE BEST ESTIMATES OF THE METEOROLOGY BUT LACK THE RESOLUTION AND FIDELITY THAT ARE TARGETED NEAR THE MARINE MARGIN. EXISTING PRODUCTS FROM GLOBAL AND REGIONAL PROJECTS WILL BE ANALYZED IN TERMS FIDELITY AT LOCAL SCALES. WE WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE APPARENT ATMOSPHERIC VARIABILITY CAN BE RELATED TO OBSERVED FJORD-SHELF VARIABILITY  AND TO OBSERVED GLACIER FLOWSPEED AND THINNING.  4. PROCESS STUDIES ARE PROPOSED FOR TWO GLACIER/FJORD SYSTEMS IN EAST GREENLAND  79NORTH GLACIER/FJORD AND HELHEIM GLACIER/SERMILIK FJORD  WHICH COVER A VARIETY OF RELEVANT CHARACTERISTICS (LARGE DRAINAGE BASINS; VERTICAL VERSUS SLANTED OCEAN-ICE INTERFACE; LARGE VERSUS SMALL BASAL RUNOFF). THE USE OF HYDROGRAPHIC AND  WHERE POSSIBLE  REMOTE SENSING OBSERVATIONS WILL PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE BASIS FOR LINKING LOCAL PROCESSES TO LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION CHANGES.  5. BASED ON CIRCUM-GREENLAND-FORCED FJORD SIMULATIONS AND MELT RATE ESTIMATES  TRANSIENT ISSM SIMULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED TO ASSESS IMPLICATIONS FOR ICE SHEET CHANGES. SEVERAL CRITICAL ISSM IMPROVEMENTS WILL IMPLEMENTED  INCLUDING CALVING FRONT DYNAMICS. SENSITIVITY CALCULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DATA COLLECED AT THE TWO PROCESS REGIONS TO ASSESS DYNAMIC THINNING AND GLACIER FRONT RETREAT IN RESPONSE TO LARGE-SCALE OCEANIC AND CLIMATE VARIABILITY.  6.

THIS IS THE LEAD INSTITUTION PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO FOR THE U.S. PARTICIPATION IN THE EXTREME UNIVERSE SPACE OBSERVATORY ON THE JAPANESE EXPERIMENT MODULE. WE PROPOSE TO DISCOVER THE ORIGIN OF EXTREME ENERGY COSMIC RAYS  THOSE WITH ENERGIES IN EXCESS OF 60 EEV  PRODUCED BY THE MOST POWERFUL COSMIC ACCELERATORS IN THE UNIVERSE. WE WILL USE THE EXTREME-UNIVERSE SPACE OBSERVATORY (EUSO) INSTRUMENT  WHICH IS TO BE ATTACHED TO THE JAPANESE EXPERIMENT MODULE (JEM) ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS). JEM-EUSO IS BEING DEVELOPED BY AN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION FOR LAUNCH ON THE JAPANESE H2 TRANSFER VEHICLE IN 2017. THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR THE US CONTRIBUTION TO THE MISSION WHICH CONSISTS OF MONITORING AND CALIBRATION WITH A GLOBAL LIGHT SYSTEM (GLS) OF LASERS AND XENON LIGHT SOURCES  DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS SOFTWARE  DATA ARCHIVING  AND SCIENCE RESULTS FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF THE MISSION. WE ALSO PROPOSE THAT NASA MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE UPMASS NEEDED TO LAUNCH JEM-EUSO AND ATTACHMENT POINT RESOURCES. THE GLS FOR JEM-EUSO WILL BE LOCATED AT 12 SITES AROUND THE WORLD  SUPPLEMENTED WITH AN AIRCRAFT SYSTEM. THE CALIBRATED UV LASERS AND XENON FLASH LAMPS WILL GENERATE CALIBRATED OPTICAL SIGNATURES IN THE ATMOSPHERE WITHIN THE FIELD OF VIEW OF JEM-EUSO WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS TO THE OPTICAL SIGNALS OF COSMIC RAY EXTENSIVE AIR SHOWERS. THROUGHOUT ITS PIONEERING MISSION  JEM-EUSO WILL RECONSTRUCT THE POINTING DIRECTIONS OF THE LASERS AND THE ENERGY OF THE LASERS AND FLASH LAMPS TO MONITOR THEDETECTOR'S TRIGGERS  AND ACCURACY OF ENERGY AND DIRECTION RECONSTRUCTION. THESE ARE THE CRITICAL PARAMETERS FOR IDENTIFYING THE SOURCES OF THE HIGHEST ENERGY COSMIC RAYS AND FOR EVALUATING THE SCIENTIFIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS PIONEERING INSTRUMENT. STARTING IN 2014  A PROTOTYPE OF THE JEM-EUSO INSTRUMENT WILL BE FLOWN ON A BALLOON TO TEST ITS DESIGN.

A CONSIDERABLE BODY OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE IMPACT AT CHICXULUB AS THE ULTIMATE TRIGGER OF THE MASS EXTINCTION  BUT THE DYNAMICS OF THE SUBSEQUENT RECOVERY ARE STILL NOT ENTIRELY UNDERSTOOD. THE DOMINANT SKELETONIZED PHYTOPLANKTON GROUPS AT THIS TIME INCLUDE THE CALCAREOUS NANNOPLANKTON  DINOFLAGELLATES AND DIATOMS. THE CALCAREOUS NANNOPLANKTON WERE DECIMATED WITH APPROXIMATELY 85% OF GENERA AND 93% OF SPECIES GOING EXTINCT. HOWEVER  DIATOMS HAD ~85% SURVIVAL ACROSS THE BOUNDARY AND DINOFLAGELLATES ACTUALLY INCREASED IN DIVERSITY. THESE NON-CALCAREOUS PLANKTON MOST LIKELY SURVIVED BECAUSE OF THEIR ABILITY TO FORM STRESS-RESISTANT RESTING CYSTS AND BECAUSE THEY WERE BETTER ADAPTED TO HIGH-STRESS ENVIRONMENTS. AS PART OF EXOBIOLOGY GRANT NNX07AK62 A LARGE  GLOBAL DATABASE OF NANNOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS THE K/PG BOUNDARY WAS COMPILED LEADING TO THE DISCOVERY THAT THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE OCEANS SUFFERED HIGHER NANNOPLANKTONEXTINCTION RATES THAN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE WITH AN ECOLOGICAL ""CRISIS"" THAT LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 350 THOUSAND YEARS AFTER THE IMPACT. HOWEVER  NO STUDY HAS COMBINED ALL OF THE SKELETONIZED PLANKTON INTO A SINGLE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE HOW NON-CALCAREOUS PLANKTON INFLUENCED THE OCEANIC RECOVERY. THIS STUDY IS DESIGNED TO ASSESS HOW DIATOM  DINOFLAGELLATES AND NANNOPLANKTON ECOSYSTEMS  ESPECIALLY THOSE ON SHELVES  WERE ADAPTED TO SURVIVAL AT THE K/PG BOUNDARY. THIS INVESTIGATION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SHELF ENVIRONMENTS OFFERED REFUGES TO PHYTOPLANKTON TAXA IN THE IMMEDIATE WAKE OF THE IMPACT  WHETHER THESE ENVIRONMENTS ""SEEDED"" ASSEMBLAGES DURING THE RECOVERY INTERVAL  AND WHAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIATOMS  DINOFLAGELLATES ANDNANNOPLANKTON TELLS US ABOUT KILLING MECHANISMS AS WELL AS THE DYNAMICS OF THE RECOVERY. ECOLOGICAL RECOVERY OF ALL PHYTOPLANKTON GROUPS LIKELY TOOK PLACE ONLY AFTER THE BIOLOGIC PUMP WAS RESTORED AFTER THE K/PG EXTINCTION. THE PROPOSED STUDY IS ALSO DESIGNED TO REFINE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE RECOVERY OF THE BIOLOGICAL PUMP CONTROLLED THE RECOVERY OF PHYTOPLANKTON ECOSYSTEMS.  NANNOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGES WILL BE STUDIED IN SELECTED NORTHERN HEMISPHERE SHELF SECTIONS AND IN MORE NUMEROUS SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SHELF AND DEEP-SEA SECTIONS. INVESTIGATION OF NANNOPLANKTON WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED WHEREVER POSSIBLE WITH DIATOMS ANDDINOFLAGELLATES: DIATOMS IN SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SHELF SECTIONS AND DINOFLAGELLATES IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SHELVES AND SLOPE DEPOSITS. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT DIATOMS AND DINOFLAGELLATES MAY HAVE HELPED (VIA REMOVAL OF EXCESS NUTRIENTS AND METALS) OR HINDERED (VIA COMPETITION) THE RECOVERY OF NANNOPLANKTON. WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY HYPOTHESES TO EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF THERECOVERY: 1. EARLIEST PALEOCENE NANNOPLANKTON ORIGINATED IN THE SHELF ENVIRONMENTS AND SPREAD THROUGH THE OCEAN AFTER THE K/PG EVENT; 2. THE SHELVES OFFERED A REFUGE FOR NANNOPLANKTON AT THE BOUNDARY  AND OTHER PLANKTON GROUPS (DIATOMS AND DINOFLAGELLATES) COULD HAVE EITHER HELPED OR HINDERED THE NANNOPLANKTON RECOVERY; 3. THE BIOLOGICAL PUMP PAVED THE WAY FOR SITES TO BECOME HABITABLE BY REMOVING TOXIC METALS AND EXCESS NUTRIENTS FROM THE SURFACE OCEAN; AND 4. SURFACE ACIDIFICATION WAS NOT SEVERE ENOUGH TO CAUSEEXTINCTION  BUT METAL POISONING AMPLIFIED EXTINCTION AND PROLONGED RECOVERY.

THIS PROJECT ENGAGES 10 AMERICORPS*VISTAS IN EFFECTIVE ANTI-POVERTY SERVICE BY PROVIDING ON-SITE CAPACITY BUILDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ANTI-POVERTY ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE FIVE BOROUGHS OF NEW YORK CITY. AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS OF THE CURRENT PROJECT, NYCCAH WILL PROVIDE COST-SHARE FUNDING FOR THREE OF THE VISTA MEMBERS. DURING THE 2011-2012 PROJECT YEAR, ONE VISTA WAS BASED AT NYCCAH HEADQUARTERS TO FURTHER BUILD CAPACITY IN VOLUNTEER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. A VISTA LEADER WAS ALSO BASED AT THE MAIN OFFICE AND WAS UTILIZED TO ASSIST WITH RECRUITING, TRAINING, AND TEAM-BUILDING. 

FOR THE CURRENT GRANT YEAR (2012-2013), TWO VISTA MEMBERS WILL BE BASED AT NYCCAH HEADQUARTERS. THESE POSITIONS INCLUDE: VISTA LEADER AND A VISTA WORKING WITH OUR VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENT.  NYCCAH WILL PLACE THE REMAINING NINE VISTAS DIRECTLY AT EMERGENCY FEEDING PROGRAMS (EFPS) -- FOOD PANTRIES AND SOUP KITCHENS -- OR CITYWIDE ANTI-HUNGER/ANTI-POVERTY ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE FIVE BOROUGHS OF NEW YORK CITY. THESE VISTAS WILL PROVIDE CAPACITY-BUILDING HELP AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THESE COMMUNITY-BASED AGENCIES TO BUILD SYSTEMS TO MORE EFFECTIVELY FIGHT POVERTY IN LOW-INCOME AREAS OF NEW YORK CITY. 

IN ITS FIRST HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL THREE-YEAR VISTA PROJECT (2002-2003, 2004-2005, AND 2005-2006), NYCCAH'S PRIMARY FOCUS FOR THE PROJECT WAS CREATING AND SUSTAINING ""NEIGHBORHOOD NETWORKS"" OF EMERGENCY FOOD PROVIDERS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE VISTA HOST SITES. THE NETWORKS AIM TO: IMPROVE SOCIAL SERVICES IN LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS, REDUCE DUPLICATION, PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SOUP KITCHENS AND FOOD PANTRIES, AND BRING KITCHENS AND PANTRIES TOGETHER FOR JOINT INITIATIVES AND COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS. FROM NYCCAH'S SECOND THREE-YEAR VISTA PROJECT ONWARD, THE PRIMARY FOCUS SHIFTED AWAY FROM NEIGHBORHOOD NETWORKS -- ALTHOUGH CREATING AND SUSTAINING ""COMMUNITY CAPACITY-BUILDING CONSORTIUMS"" IS STILL A MAJOR WORKPLAN COMPONENT AND THE VISTA TEAM IS WORKING TO EXPAND THE EFFECTIVENESS AND PROGRAMMING OF THESE NETWORKS -- TO BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING AGENCY CAPACITY THROUGH INTENSIVE, INDIVIDUALIZED, HIGH-QUALITY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE FOCUS IN THE UPCOMING 2012-2013 PROGRAM YEAR. 

FOR THE 2012-2013 VISTA PROGRAM YEAR, SOME VISTAS WILL BE PLACED AT NEW SITES WHILE OTHERS WILL BE PLACED AT SITES THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY HOSTED VISTA MEMBERS AND HAVE FURTHER CAPACITY-BUILDING ASSISTANCE NEEDS. AS IN PREVIOUS PROJECT YEARS, NYCCAH WILL CONTINUE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE BY SITE SUPERVISORS WITH ALL VISTA REGULATIONS SO ALL NYCCAH VISTA MEMBERS ARE WORKING TOWARDS THE ANTI-HUNGER POVERTY GOALS OF THE VISTA PROGRAM.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,M,NONPROFIT WITH 501C3 IRS STATUS (OTHER THAN AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION),2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,2018-09-28 18:51:11.293983+00

RECENT STUDIES OF FLOODS OVER NORTH WESTERN INDIA AND ESPECIALLY PAKISTAN STRONGLY SUGGEST (LAU AND KIM 2011; HONG ET AL.  2011; ZHANG ET AL.  2012)  A WESTWARD EXTENSION OF THE MONSOONAL UPPER TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOWS AT 200 HPA LEVEL WITH A WESTWARD SHIFT OF THE TIBETAN HIGH. TROPOSPHERIC HEAT AND MOISTURE TRANSPORTS FROM AROUND THE WESTERN FLANKS OF THE TIBETAN HIGH BRING WARM MOIST AIR TOWARDS CENTRAL ASIA NORTH OF THE HIMALAYAS THE UPPER ANTICYCLONE OF THE MONSOON IS THE WARMEST TROPOSPHERIC WEATHER FEATURES THE CIRCULATING AIR AROUND THE TIBETAN HIGH  DURING EPISODES OF HEAVY RAINS OVER THE NORTHWESTERN INDIA AND PAKISTAN REGION  DESCENDS NORTH OF THE HIMALAYAS WHERE THE SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURE HAS INCREASED BY NEARLY 5OC DURING A PRESENT DECADE COMPARED TO A PREVIOUS DECADE  ZHANG ET AL (2012)  THAT WARMING IS CONVEYED TO THE ARCTIC LATITUDES BY THE LARGE AMPLITUDE BAROCLINIC DISTURBANCES OF EURASIA. THOSE MERIDIONAL TRANSPORTS OF HEAT AND MOISTURE ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RECENT DECLINE OF THE ARCTIC SEA ICE. THE ATMOSPHERIC WIND DATA COVERAGE IS A MAJOR COMPONENT IN ALL SUCH TRANSPORT PROBLEMS. ZHANG ET AL ( 2012) SHOW MAJOR CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CENTRAL ASIAN SUFACE AIR WARMING REGION AND THE ARCTIC ICE MELT REGION VIA TRANSPORTS OF MOISTURE VIA THE SO CALLED ATMOSPHERIC MOIST RIVERS. WE PROPOSE TO EXAMINE THIS FEATURE FROM SEVERAL OBSERVATIONAL EPISODES AND MODELING.PRIOR TO THE LAUNCH OF A GLOBAL WIND LIDAR CARRYING SATELLITE  SUBORBITAL AIRCRAFT MISSIONS ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN ARABIAN SEA WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO MONITOR THE WESTWARD EXTENSION OF THE TIBETAN HIGH THAT CAN BE SEEN AS FAR SOUTH AS 15ON LATITUDE. THE ATMOSPHERIC STATE CAN BE DESCRIBED BY INVOKING PHYSICAL INITIALIZATION IN A GLOBAL FORECAST MODEL (KRISHNAMURTI ET.AL. 1991). IN PRINCIPLE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO STUDY THE IMPACTS OF ENHANCING THE INITIAL MONSOON RAINFALL OVER THE NORTH WESTERN PARTS OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN BY 10- 40% SEQUENTIALLY IN A SERIES OF 10 DAY LONG FORECAST EXPERIMENTS. IN SUCH EXPERIMENTS WE SHALL KEEP TRACK OF MERIDIONAL TRANSPORTS OF HEAT AND MOISTURE ACROSS MIDDLE AND POLAR LATITUDES FROM 40ON TO 60ON. THE TIBETAN HIGH AND THE WINDS TO THE WEST OF THE TIBETAN HIGH CAN BE EXPECTED TO CHANGE IN THESE EXPERIMENTS.THIS PROPOSAL IS COGNIZANT OF THE PROPOSED OBSERVATIONAL CAPABILITIES OF CYGNSS AND PATH FOR SURFACE WINDS AND SURFACE FLUXES. THE DATA SETS FROM THOSE SATELLITES WOULD COMPLEMENT THE PROPOSED WORK SINCE PHYSICAL INITIALIZATION INVOKES BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS AND SURFACE FLUXES. IT IS OUR INTENTION TO DEVELOP THE NEXT VERSION OF PHYSICAL INITIALIZATION THAT WOULD EXPLOIT THE DATA SETS FROM CYGNESS  PATH AND A WIND LIDAR. WE ARE SUGGESTING THE MONSOONAL CONNECTION BASED THAT SHOWS THE MASSIVE MONSOON GYRE OF THE TIBETAN HIGH COMPLEX SITTING CLOSE TO THE SURFACE WARMING BELT OF CENTRAL ASIA. THE MODELING EXPERIMENTS WOULD THUS SUGGEST WHERE THE LARGEST CHANGES IN THE WINDS MAY BE NOTED. THE NORTHERN ARABIAN SEA  CURRENTLY LACKING UPPER AIR WIND OBSERVATIONS  IS A REGION THAT WOULD BE OF INTEREST FOR SUCH PLANETARY SCALE TELECONNECTIONS. WE ALSO PROSE TO INCLUDE DETAILED HEAT BUDGETS FOR THREE REGIONS THAT INCLUDE THE WESTERN FLANKS OF THE TIBETAN HIGH  THE CENTRAL ASIAN SURFACE WARMING REGION AND THE ARCTIC ICE MET REGION AND THEIR TELECONNECTIONS. IN OUR PROPOSAL THE MODELING RESULT WILL GIVE THE OBSERVATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR A SUBORBITAL AIRCRAFT RECONNAISSANCE CARRYING A WIND LIDAR.

THE WIREGRASS RETIRED AND SENIOR VOLUNTEER PROGRAM IS A SELF-SPONSORED ORGANIZATION LOCATED IN THE FAR SOUTHEAST CORNER OF ALABAMA AND INCLUDES REPRESENTATION IN THE THREE COUNTY AREAS OF HOUSTON, GENEVA AND HENRY. 
ON APRIL 1,2014 WRSVP BEGAN THE SECOND YEAR OF A THREE YEAR GRANT CYCLE. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR PROGRAMMING WE HAVE MET SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN OUT OF OUR CONTROL. DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WE WERE FORCED AFTER THIRTY YEARS TO MOVE OUR OFFICE TO A NEW LOCATION. WHILE OUR NEW SPACE IS NEW AND VERY SUITABLE IT HAS TAKEN TIME TO REORGANIZE AND ADVERTISE OUR NEW LOCATIONS ADDRESS, TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND E-MAIL ADDRESS.
IN THE SPRING OF 2014 THE PROGRAM DIRECTORS SPOUSE EXPERIENCED A HEART ATTACK WHICH REQUIRED HER TO BE ABSENT FROM WORK FOR THREE TO FOUR WEEKS. IN JUNE OF 2014 THE ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT RESIGNED DUE TO REOCCURRING HEALTH ISSUES.
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGE WHO OVERSEES OUR JUVENILE TRUANCY PROJECT RESIGNED HIS JUDGESHIP TO BECOME JUDGE OF CRIMINAL COURT SERVICES. THE TRUANCY OFFICER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH ASSIGNED TO ASSIST WITH THIS PROJECT RESIGNED TO RETURN TO HER HOMETOWN TO TAKE CARE OF HER AGING PARENTS.THIS LOSS LEFT OUR JUVENILE/TRUANCY PROJECT INOPERABLE FOR 4-5 MONTHS.
HOWEVER, TO DATE OUR PROJECT IS GETTING BACK ON TRACK. DUE TO THE STRONG LEADERSHIP OF OUR BOARD, STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUSTAIN OUR PROGRAM AND PROJECTS AS OUTLINED IN OUR GRANT APPLICATION.
AN ESTIMATED 341 UNDUPLICATED RETIRED AND SENIOR VOLUNTEERS WILL SERVE 24,466 UNDUPLICATED COMMUNITY INDIVIDUALS.  THEY WILL SERVE TO PROVIDE TRAINING IN DISASTER PREPAREDNESS, COMMUNITY BASED MENTORING FOR JUVENILES, TUTORING IN PUBLIC, SCHOOLS, ASSIST VETERANS WITH TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES, FOOD DISTRIBUTION THRU FOOD BANKS, FOOD PANTRY SUPPORT AND FOOD DELIVERY AND FOOD COLLECTION PROGRAMS, WILL PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION, MEALS AND COMPANIONSHIP TO THE SICK AND HOME-BOUND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, AS WELL AS SERVE TO HELP THE NEEDS OF OTHER COMMUNITY PROJECTS THROUGH A NETWORK OF THIRTY-TWO (32) VOLUNTEER STATIONS SUCH AS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATIONS, JUVENILE COURT SERVICES, VETERAN'S CLINIC, WIREGRASS AREA FOOD BANK, TWO LOCAL SCHOOLS, SOUTHEAST ALABAMA MEDICAL CENTER, THE HARBOR,  AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, AARP TAX AID FOR THE ELDERLY, CHRISTIAN MISSION FOOD DELIVERY, DIALYSIS CLINIC, WIREGRASS HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND THE WIREGRASS UNITED WAY.  THE PRIMARY FOCUS AREA OF THIS PROJECT IS EDUCATION: K-12 SUCCESS TO ADDRESS JUVENILE TRUANCY.  AT THE END OF THE 12-MONTH PERFORMANCE PERIOD, ONE HUNDRED NINETY-FIVE (195) JUVENILE WILL HAVE BEEN MENTORED BY EIGHTY-FIVE (85) RSVP VOLUNTEERS. OF THIS NUMBER, 175 YOUTH WILL HAVE IMPROVED THEIR SCHOOL ATTENDANCE.

THE MISSION OF THE DREAM PROGRAM (DREAM) IS TO BUILD COMMUNITIES OF FAMILIES AND COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT EMPOWER CHILDREN FROM DISADVANTAGED CIRCUMSTANCES TO RECOGNIZE THEIR OPTIONS, MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS, AND ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS.  DREAM BEGAN IN 1999 AS A STUDENT RUN ORGANIZATION AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE WORKING WITH CHILDREN FROM THE TEMPLETON COURT APARTMENTS IN WHITE RIVER JUNCTION.  THE ORGANIZATION WAS INCORPORATED AS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION IN 2001 AND BEGAN TO REPLICATE THEIR MODEL IN OTHER LOW-INCOME HOUSING COMMUNITIES IN VERMONT.
DREAM SERVES GOVERNMENT-SUBSIDIZED, LOW AND VERY LOW-INCOME HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS.  DREAM SERVES RESIDENTS OF THE NORTHWOODS AND HOLLOW DRIVE APARTMENTS IN WHITE RIVER JUNCTION, THE ARMORY SQUARE APARTMENTS IN WINDSOR, THE ELM STREET APARTMENTS AND FRANKLIN STREET APARTMENTS IN WINOOSKI, THE FRANKLIN SQUARE APARTMENTS IN BURLINGTON, THE GREEN ACRES AND HIGHGATE APARTMENTS IN BARRE, THE FOREST PARK APARTMENTS IN RUTLAND AND THE BIRCHWOOD MOBILE HOME PARK IN MILTON.  THESE COMMUNITIES ALL HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF POVERTY AND OTHER RISK FACTORS.

CONSEQUENTLY ACCURATE MODELING OF RADIATION BELT VARIABILITY  IN RESPONSE TO CHANGE IN THE SOLAR WIND OR GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY  REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL MODELS FOR IMPORTANT MAGNETOSPHERIC WAVES. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP IMPROVED MODELS FOR THE GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION AND SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF THREE IMPORTANT WAVES (CHORUS  PLASMASPHERIC HISS  AND EQUATORIAL MAGNETOSONIC WAVES) USING DATA FROM THEMIS  DE1 AND RBSP ONCE IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. WE WILL ALSO ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY THE PARTICLE DISTRIBUTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAVE EXCITATION. CHORUS IS AN ELECTROMAGNETIC EMISSION PRODUCED IN THE LOW-DENSITY REGION OUTSIDE THE PLASMAPAUSE  WHICH CAN CAUSE BOTH PRECIPITATION LOSS AND LOCAL ACCELERATION OF ENERGETIC ELECTRONS. DETAILED MODELING OF NIGHTSIDE CHORUS HAS ALREADY BEEN OBTAINED FROM CRRES DATA  BUT THE SATELLITE COVERAGE WAS EXTREMELY RESTRICTED ON THE DAYSIDE  AND MANY IMPORTANT PROPERTIES OF DAYSIDE CHORUS REMAIN POORLY ESTABLISHED. THE FIVE THEMIS SPACECRAFT HAVE EXCELLENT SPATIAL COVERAGE FOR OVER 3 YEARS OVER THE ENTIRE CHORUS SOURCE REGION. SPECIFICALLY THIS DATA WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP AN IMPROVED MODEL FOR DAYSIDE CHORUS  AND IDENTIFY THE MECHANISM FOR CHORUS EXCITATION. WE WILL ALSO MODEL THE PROPERTIES OF PLASMASPHERIC HISS  WHICH PROVIDES THE DOMINANT LOSS PROCESS FOR ENERGETIC ELECTRONS DURING QUIET PERIODS IN THE EXTENDED STORM RECOVERY PHASE  AND TEST THE PROPOSED ORIGIN OF HISS FROM CHORUS. EQUATORIAL MAGNETOSONIC WAVES MAY CONTRIBUTE TO LOCAL ELECTRON ACCELERATION  BUT OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAVE PROPERTIES IS LIMITED TO A VERY RESTRICTED RANGE OF L-SHELLS (CLUSTER) OR WAVE FREQUENCIES (CRRES). THE THEMIS DATA WILL ALLOW US TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE GLOBAL MODEL FOR THE POWER SPECTRAL INTENSITY OF THIS IMPORTANT EMISSION AND IT'S RELATIONSHIP TO ION RING DISTRIBUTIONS. THE IMPROVED WAVE MODELS WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE QUASI-LINEAR DIFFUSION RATES  WHICH CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO DYNAMIC MODELS OF THE RADIATION BELTS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ADDRESSES THE NASA STRATEGIC GOAL 3.2 LISTED IN THE 2007-2016 SCIENCE PLAN: UNDERSTAND THE SUN AND ITS EFFECTS ON EARTH AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM. IT ALSO ADDRESSES SEVERAL KEY SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2009-2030 HELIOPHYSICS ROADMAP:1) UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL PROCESSES OF THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE SUN TO EARTH.2) UNDERSTAND THE PLASMA PROCESSES THAT ACCELERATE AND TRANSPORT PARTICLES.3) UNDERSTAND CHANGES IN THE EARTH'S MAGNETOSPHERE  IONOSPHERE  AND UPPER ATMOSPHERE TO ENABLE SPECIFICATION  PREDICTION  AND MITIGATION OF THEIR EFFECTS.THE PROPOSED TOPICS FOR STUDY ARE DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE CURRENT NASA MISSIONS ON THE TIME HISTORY OF EVENTS AND MACROSCOPIC INTERACTIONS DURING SUBSTORMS (THEMIS) AND THE RADIATION BELT STORM PROBES (RBSP) OF THE LIVING WITH A STAR PROGRAM.,NON,,H,,2,,2018-01-05 16:46:14.311975+00

MACC IS  DEDICATED TO FULFILLING THE CIVIC PURPOSES OF HIGHER EDUCATION. IN THE MIDST OF DIRE WARNINGS OF ECONOMIC AND CIVIC RECESSION, WE BELIEVE THERE IS GREAT PROMISE IN LEVERAGING THE POWER OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TO FOSTER VITAL, VIBRANT, AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. MACC HAS A LONG HISTORY OF SUPPORTING CAMPUS-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS, WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THESE COLLABORATIONS HAVE THE ABILITY TO FOSTER CIVIC AND ECONOMIC CHANGE. CONNECTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN STRATEGIC WAYS ALLOWS MACC INSTITUTIONS TO HAVE A SUPPORT COMMUNITY RENEWAL ACROSS MASSACHUSETTS.
EACH YEAR, MACC SUPPORTS MEMBER INSTITUTIONS WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, ADVISING AND NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES. THIS INCLUDES REGIONAL AND STATE-WIDE GATHERINGS, DEVELOPING AND DISTRIBUTING RESOURCES, AND PROVIDING INDIVIDUALIZED CONSULTING TO CAMPUSES. THESE EFFORTS FOCUS ON SUPPORTING CAMPUSES IN ENGAGING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN FOCUSED, DEDICATED, AND MEANINGFUL WAYS.
AS PART OF THE NATIONAL CAMPUS COMPACT NETWORK MACC IS ONE OF OVER 30 STATE OFFICES THAT COLLABORATE TO SUPPORT INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO MOBILIZING HIGHER EDUCATION RESOURCES TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT COMMUNITY ISSUES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
THE MACC VISTA PROGRAM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DEEPENING HIGHER EDUCATION'S IMPACT ON LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES THROUGH A FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE INTERNAL SYSTEMS FOR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF RECIPROCAL PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COLLEGES AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AS A RESULT OF MACC VISTA EFFORTS, THERE ARE MORE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THERE ARE MORE STUDENTS CIVICALLY ENGAGED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THROUGH VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE FEDERAL WORK-STUDY, AND SERVICE LEARNING PROGRAMS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  OVERALL, THERE IS AN INCREASED CAPACITY FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO CONTINUE TO SERVE COMMUNITIES IN MEANINGFUL WAYS. 

NON-PROFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS (CBOS) FACE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES. THESE CAN INCLUDE AN INCREASING DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES THAT DOES NOT MATCH THEIR CAPACITY; FEWER RESOURCES; UNMET FUNDING NEEDS; AND INCREASING NEED FOR ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION. DEVELOPING A PARTNERSHIP WITH A NEIGHBORING COLLEGE AND/OR UNIVERSITY CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO RESPOND TO THESE CHALLENGES.

25 MACC AMERICORPS*VISTA MEMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, BUILD, SUPPORT, AND DEEPEN CAMPUS-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS FOR EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. THESE PARTNERSHIPS WILL STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS TO ALLEVIATE POVERTY IN LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES BY LEVERAGING THE RESOURCES OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. TO SUPPORT THIS SPECIFIC FOCUS, MACC AMERICORPS*VISTA MEMBERS MUST SPEND NO LESS THAN 25% OF THEIR TIME EMBEDDED IN THE COMMUNITY. AS A RESULT, INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL MISSIONS AND DIRECTLY ADDRESS ISSUES THAT EFFECT THEIR CONSTITUENCIES, LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT MASSACHUSETTS.  STRATEGIC AND SUSTAINABLE RELATIONSHIPS AND PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COLLEGES AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL RESULT IN A GREATER ALIGNMENT OF RESOURCES AND NEEDS BETWEEN PARTNERS, INCREASED NUMBERS OF STUDENTS AND FACULTY INVOLVED IN SERVICE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES, SYSTEMS FOR THE TARGETED USE OF RESOURCES, AND MECHANISMS TO EVALUATE IMPACT OVER TIME.

AN ESTIMATED 54 FGP VOLUNTEERS WILL SERVE AS MENTORS/TUTORS IN SCHOOLS, NON-PROFIT DAY CARE CENTERS, HEAD START CENTERS, AND EXTENDED TIME PROGRAMS THAT SERVE AT-RISK YOUTH THROUGH AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER PROGRAMS.  SOME OF THEIR ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE TUTORING STUDENTS IDENTIFIED BY SITE STAFF, WORKING WITH STUDENTS ON TEACHER ASSIGNED TASKS ONE-ON-ONE AND IN SMALL GROUPS, HELPING WITH CLASSROOM ASSIGNMENTS, READING TO OR WITH CHILDREN, AND PROVIDING ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT.  THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO IMPROVE SCHOOL READINESS AND K-12 SUCCESS FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE TESTING BELOW GRADE LEVEL.   ACCORDING TO STACY LEMELIN, PRINCIPAL OF MEADOWLARK ELEMENTARY IN BILLINGS, ""FOSTER GRANDPARENTS ARE PART OF OUR INTERVENTION PLAN.  STUDENTS RARELY GET RETAINED WHEN THEY END THE SCHOOL YEAR BELOW GRADE LEVEL.  THEY ARE ADVANCED TO THE NEXT GRADE BUT ARE THEN ASSIGNED AN INTERVENTION PLAN THAT IS TARGETED TO FILL IN THE GAPS AND HOLES OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE.  THE FOSTER GRANDPARENTS FIT WELL WITH THIS PLAN AND ARE USED TO PROVIDE THE RICH LANGUAGE AND VOCABULARY THAT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS NEED.  STUDENTS WHO DO NOT GET THE EXTRA HELP THAT FOSTER GRANDPARENTS PROVIDE, ARE MORE LIKELY TO STRUGGLE AT THE NEXT GRADE LEVEL AND FALL FURTHER BEHIND.

AES IS AN ADVANCED SYSTEM THAT FACILITATES EFFICIENT EXPLORATION AND ANALYSIS OF EARTH SCIENCE DATA. WHILE AES IS WELL SUITED FOR THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF SEARCHING FOR PHENOMENA IN REGULARLY GRIDDED DATA RE ANALYSES  TARGETED EXTENSIONS WOULD ENABLE A MUCH BROADER CLASS OF EARTH SCIENCE INVESTIGATIONS TO EXPLOIT THE PERFORMANCE AND FLEXIBILITY OF THIS SERVICE. WE PRESENT A RELEVANCY SCENARIO  EVENT BASED HYDRO METEOROLOGICAL SCIENCE DATA ANALYSIS  WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR THESE FEATURES THAT WOULD MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL OF DERECHOS FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.  PROPOSED SOLUTION WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP DERECHOS  AN EXTENSION OF AES  THAT 1. GENERALIZES THE UNDERLYING REPRESENTATION TO SUPPORT IRREGULARLY SPACED OBSERVATIONS SUCH AS POINT AND SWATH DATA  2. INCORPORATES APPROPRIATE REGRIDDING AND INTERPOLATION UTILITIES TO ENABLE ANALYSIS ACROSS DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES  3. INTRODUCES NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION NDR TO FACILITATE IDENTIFICATION OF SCIENTIFIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG HIGH DIMENSIONAL DATASETS  AND 4. INTEGRATES MOVING OBJECT DATABASE TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE TREATMENT OF CONTINUITY FOR THE EVENTS WITH COARSE REPRESENTATION IN TIME. WITH THESE FEATURES  DERECHOS WILL BECOME A POWERFUL ENVIRONMENT THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR A VERY WIDE VARIETY OF EARTH SCIENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS.RESEARCH STRATEGY DERECHOS WILL BE CREATED BY INTEGRATING VARIOUS SEPARATELY DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES. IN MOST CASES THIS WILL REQUIRE SOME REIMPLEMENTATION TO EXPLOIT SCIDB  THE UNDERLYING DATABASE THAT HAS STRONG SUPPORT FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCIENTIFIC DATA. WHERE POSSIBLE  SYNTHETIC DATAINPUTS WILL BE GENERATED TO FACILITATE INDEPENDENT TESTING OF NEW COMPONENTS. A SCIENTIFIC USE CASE WILL BE USED TO DERIVE SPECIFIC INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS AND TO DEMONSTRATE INTEGRATION SUCCESS. SIGNIFICANCE FRESHWATER RESOURCES ARE PREDICTED TO BE A MAJOR FOCUS OF CONTENTION AND CONFLICT IN THE 21ST CENTURY. THUS  HYDROMETEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY COMMUNITIES ARE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTED BY THE SUPERIOR RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH AES  WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR TWO REAL WORLD USE CASES. THIS INTEREST IS REFLECTED BY THE PARTICIPATION IN DERECHOS OF OUR ESTEEMED COLLABORATORS  WHO INCLUDE THE PROJECT SCIENTIST OF NASA SMAP  THE PRINCIPAL SCIENTIST OF NOAA MRMS  AND LEAD ALGORITHM DEVELOPERS OF NASA GPM. RELEVANCE TO THE PROGRAM ELEMENT THIS PROPOSAL RESPONDS TO THE CORE AIST PROGRAM TOPIC 2.1.3 DATA CENTRIC TECHNOLOGIES. DERECHOS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE REQUEST FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS  INCLUDING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR DATA FUSION AND DATA MINING  APPLIED TO THE SUBSTANTIAL DATA AND METADATA THAT RESULT FROM EARTH SCIENCE OBSERVATION AND THE USE OF OTHER DATA CENTRIC TECHNOLOGIES. TRL ALTHOUGH AES WILL HAVE ACHIEVED AN EXIT TRL OF 5 BY THE START DATE OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT  DERECHOS WILL HAVE AN ENTRY TRL OF 3 DUE TO THE NEW INNOVATIONS THAT HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE UNDERLYING SCIDB DATABASE.

OBSERVATIONS AT 10 WAVELENGTHS  FROM THE UV TO THE NEAR IR  AT A RESOLVABLE SIZE OF 24KM AT THE SUB-SATELLITE POINT WILL BE DOWNLOADED EVERY HOUR. WE PROPOSE THREE SETS OF AEROSOL-RELATED RESEARCH ACTIVITIES INVOLVING EPIC OBSERVATIONS. TIER-1 PRODUCTS CONSIST OF DIRECT USES OF EPIC DATA IN APPLICATIONS FOR WHICH THE COARSE SPATIAL RESOLUTION HAS LITTLE OR NO EFFECT  AND FOR WHICH ROBUST  DOCUMENTED INVERSION TECHNIQUES ARE AVAILABLE. THESE PRODUCTS ARE ABSORBING AEROSOL INDEX (AAI)  AND ABOVE-CLOUD-AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH (ACAOD). THESE PRODUCTS WILL BE AVAILABLE BY THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR.  TIER-2 APPLICATIONS  ON THE OTHER HAND  ARE THOSE THAT REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF A RIGOROUS CLOUD MASK TO IDENTIFY CLOUD-FREE AREAS FOR ACCURATE RETRIEVAL OF AEROSOL PROPERTIES. WE WILL DEVELOP A FOUR-PARAMETER RETRIEVAL APPROACH USING A COMBINATION OF UV-VIS OBSERVATIONS TO DERIVE AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH (AOD)  ANGSTROM EXPONENT (AE)  NEAR UV SINGLE SCATTERING ALBEDO (SSA)  AND EFFECTIVE AEROSOL LAYER HEIGHT (ALH). ROBUST RETRIEVAL APPROACHES ARE AVAILABLE BUT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ACCURATE RESULTS  IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE USE OF HIGH RESOLUTION LEO OBSERVATIONS TO BUILD RIGOROUS CLOUD MASKS TO OVERCOME THE SEVERE SUB-PIXEL CLOUD CONTAMINATION PROBLEM AT EPIC'S 24 KM RESOLUTION.

THEIR USEFULNESS AS PRECISION STANDARD CANDLES IS LIMITED BY SEVERAL SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE PROGENITOR SYSTEMS AND EXPLOSION DETAILS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE. OPTICAL OBSERVATIONS OF HIGH-REDSHIFT SNE PROBE REST-FRAME ULTRAVIOLET (UV) WAVELENGTHS  REQUIRING SPACE BASED OBSERVATIONS OF NEARBY SNE AGAINST WHICH TO COMPARE. THE SWIFT SATELLITE HAS ALREADY OBSERVED MORE SUPERNOVAE THAN ALL OTHER UV OBSERVATORIES COMBINED. WE PROPOSE TO CREATE AND MAKE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE A VALUE-ADDED ARCHIVE OF THE IMAGES AND PHOTOMETRY OF THE 200+ SNE OBSERVED IN THE UV BY SWIFT'S ULTRA-VIOLET/OPTICAL TELESCOPE (UVOT). WE WILL USE THIS DATA TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENT AND EXTINCTION ON THE SN IA LIGHT CURVES. WE WILL ALSO COMPARE THIS LOCAL SAMPLE OF UV LIGHT CURVES WITH HIGH REDSHIFT SNE OBSERVED IN THE OPTICAL. THE SWIFT SN ARCHIVE WILL INCLUDE FINAL PHOTOMETRY AS WELL AS THE FINAL IMAGES APPROPRIATE FOR OTHERS TO USE TO PRODUCE THEIR OWN PHOTOMETRY OF THE SNE  OTHER TRANSIENT OBJECTS IN THE FIELDS  OR THE HOST GALAXIES. FOR EACH EPOCH OF PHOTOMETRY WE WILL ALSO COMPUTE THE SPECTRUM-DEPENDENT CORRECTIONS FOR EXTINCTION AND REDSHIFT. THESE DATA WILL BE USED TO MEASURE THE UV CONTRIBUTION TO THE BOLOMETRIC LIGHT CURVE AND LOOK FOR ANY TIME DEPENDENCE TO THE EXTINCTION. WITH THE LARGER SAMPLE AVAILABLE WE WILL LOOK FOR CORRELATIONS WITH HOST GALAXY PROPERTIES. WE WILL ALSO CREATE ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE LIGHT CURVES OF SNE OF ALL TYPES FOR COMPARISON WITH EXISTING HIGH REDSHIFT OBSERVATIONS. THESE WILL ALSO BE USED TO MAKE PREDICTIONS FOR THE DETECTABILITY AND CLASSIFICATION OF HIGH REDSHIFT SNE IN THE REST-FRAME UV BY FUTURE GROUND AND SPACE-BASED TELESCOPES. THE SWIFT UV OBSERVATIONS FILL A CRITICAL NICHE IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SNE IA  AND THIS PROGRAM WILL ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC USE OF THIS IMPORTANT DATASET. THE WORK DONE AS A PART OF THIS PROGRAM AND USING THE CREATED DATA PRODUCTS WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SNE IA AND THEIR USEFULNESS AS COSMOLOGICAL PROBES TO MEASURE THE EXPANSION HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE AND UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF DARK ENERGY. SWIFT HAS INVESTED THOUSANDS OF HOURS OBSERVING OVER TWO HUNDRED SNE. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT INVESTMENT OF TIME BY PUBLICLY ARCHIVING THE DATA IN A FORM MORE USEFUL TO THE GENERAL COMMUNITY AND PROVIDING MULTI-WAVELENGTH PHOTOMETRY AND SPECTRUM DEPENDENT CORRECTION FACTORS. THIS WILL ALLOW THE SN COMMUNITY TO ADD THIS EXCELLENT UV DATA TO THEIR OWN DATA AND THEORETICAL STUDIES TO ENHANCE THEIR INVESTIGATIONS. THESE STUDIES WILL IMPROVE OUR USE OF THESE STANDARD CANDLES FOR MEASURING COSMIC DISTANCES AND THE EXPANSION HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE.

THE AMOUNT (AND LOCATION) OF THE MODE TRAPPING SEQUENCE IS A FUNCTION OF THE CORE STRUCTURE WHICH EVOLVES WITH TIME. BY SAMPLING SDB STARS OF DIFFERENT EVOLUTIONARY AGE AND ENVELOPE MASS  WE CAN USE THE SMALL DEVIATIONS OF PERIOD SPACINGS TO CONSTRAIN STRUCTURE MODELS.FREQUENCY MULTIPLETS ALSO TELL US THE ROTATION PERIOD AND ORIENTATION OF THE PULSATION AXIS. FROM THIS INFORMATION WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT ROTATION PERIODS ARE LONG (20-100 DAYS)  EVEN FOR STARS WITH BINARY PERIOD DOWN TO 0.4 DAYS. THIS IS A SURPRISING RESULT AS IT HAS BEEN ASSUMED THAT CLOSE BINARIES QUICKLY TIDALLY LOCK THEIR COMPONENTS.WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS FROM THE ORIGINAL KEPLER MISSION. HOWEVER  TO FULLY EXPLOIT THOSE ADVANCES  WE NEED TO COMPLETE THE CHARACTERIZATION OF HELIUM-FUSING CORES ACROSS THEIR RANGE OF AGE (FROM ZERO-AGE TO TERMINAL-AGE ON THE HORIZONTAL BRANCH) AND TEMPERATURE (AN INDICATOR OF THE ENVELOPE-TO-CORE MASS RATIO). IT WOULD ALSO BE A HUGE BENEFIT TO HAVE MORE EXAMPLES OF PULSATORS IN BINARIES  AS THAT ALLOWS US TO FURTHER EXPLORE HOW ANGULAR MOMENTUM IS CONSERVED AND/OR TRANSFERRED DURING ENVELOPE EJECTION.TO CONTINUE WORKING TOWARD A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF HORIZONTAL BRANCH CORES (INCLUDING MASS LOSS AND POST-HELIUM-FLASH EVOLUTION)  WE ARE PROPOSING THAT K2 OBTAIN SHORT-CADENCE (SC) OBSERVATIONS OF A SELECTION OF LIKELY SDB PULSATORS AND LONG-CADENCE (LC) OBSERVATIONS OF REMAINING SDB STARS. THE SC DATA CAN FULLY EXPLORE PULSATIONS AND SHORT-PERIOD (1 DAY) BINARIES AND WHILE THE LC DATA CAN DETECT SOME PULSATIONS WHILE STILL EXPLORING BINARY SDB STARS  ESPECIALLY THE LONGER-PERIOD ONES.OUR TEAM HAS EXTENSIVELY EXPLORED MANY ASPECTS OF SDB STARS  INCLUDING SPECTROSCOPIC CHARACTERIZATION  BINARY PROPERTIES  AND THE APPLICATION OF ASTEROSEISMIC TOOLS. WE HAVE BEEN EXAMINING SDB STARS SINCE THEIR PULSATIONS WERE DISCOVERED IN 1996 AND HAVE PUBLISHED OVER 20 PAPERS FROM KEPLER'S MAIN MISSION.WE HAVE ALSO INCORPORATED STUDENTS INTO OUR WORK. MANY OF OUR PAPERS INCLUDE GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AS SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS. MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT HAVE A GRADUATE PROGRAM  AND AS A RESULT  UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE LEARNED TO PROCESS  ANALYZE  AND INTERPRET NASA SATELLITE DATA TO DETECT PULSATIONS AND SIGNATURES OF BINARITY. THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN PRE- AND POST-KEPLER CHARACTERIZATION STUDIES  PROVIDING THEM WITH A BROAD RANGE OF TRAINING.,NON,,12,,2,,2017-06-20 00:00:00+00

VOLUNTEERS OF AMERICA (VOA) IS A NATIONAL, FAITH-BASED HUMAN SERVICE ORGANIZATION WITH 36 AFFILIATES ACROSS THE US INCLUDING WESTERN WASHINGTON. FOR OVER 100 YEARS, VOLUNTEERS OF AMERICA HAS PROVIDED HIGH QUALITY SERVICES IN THE PUGET SOUND REGION. OUR MISSION IS TO SERVE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES IN NEED AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE THE JOY OF SERVING OTHERS. TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION, VOAWW IS COMMITTED TO DELIVERING QUALITY PROGRAMS THAT UTILIZE VOLUNTEERS AND ASSIST PEOPLE IN LEADING A MORE SATISFYING, QUALITY LIFE. EACH YEAR MORE THAN 350,000 PEOPLE CONTACT VOAWW FOR SERVICES. VOAWW HAS A HISTORY OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR SENIORS. AS A SPONSOR AGENCY FOR THE CNCS FUNDED SENIOR COMPANION PROGRAM, WE ALSO HAVE A STRONG UNDERSTANDING OF REGULATIONS GUIDING SENIOR CORPS PROGRAMS. 
VOAWW OPERATES SIX PROGRAMS IN SKAGIT COUNTY -- RSVP, NORTHSOUND 211, CARE CRISIS RESPONSE SERVICES (A REGIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS LINE), THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION CENTER OF SKAGIT COUNTY, DISABILITY SERVICES (SERVING ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES) AND YOUTH AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. SKAGIT COUNTY IS A COUNTY IN WASHINGTON STATE, NAMED AFTER THE SKAGIT INDIAN TRIBE. AS OF THE 2010 CENSUS, THE POPULATION WAS 116,901. IT IS INCLUDED IN THE MOUNT VERNON-ANACORTES, WASHINGTON, AND METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA. THE SKAGIT MARITIME VALLEY HAS OVER 93,000 ACRES OF ACTIVE FARMLAND. THE SKAGIT RIVER COMPRISES THE THIRD LARGEST WATERSHED ON THE WEST COAST OF THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES WITH A DELTA GRACED BY WORKING FARMS AND WILDLIFE REFUGES. THE SKAGIT FLATS IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR AREAS FOR BIRDING IN WASHINGTON STATE. THE VALLEY'S CULTURE IS RICH IN FARMING, FISHING, NATURE, AND ART.
AN ESTIMATED 700 RSVP VOLUNTEERS WILL SERVE IN SKAGIT COUNTY THROUGH THIS GRANT. SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE: TRAIL MAINTENANCE, FOOD DISTRIBUTION, TUTORING, BUILDING HOMES, BLOOD DRIVES, AND VACATION HOME CHECKS. THE PRIMARY FOCUS AREA OF THIS PROJECT IS HEALTHY FUTURES. IN A COMMUNITY KNOWN FOR ITS AGRICULTURAL ABUNDANCE, THE HIGHEST RISK FOR PREMATURE DEATH IS THE LACK OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 75.3% OF THE ADULTS IN SKAGIT COUNTY REPORT EATING LESS THAN 5 SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER DAY (COMMUNITY STATUS RISK INDICATORS, US DEPT. OF HHS, 2013).
POVERTY IS CLOSELY LINKED TO HUNGER AND FOOD INSECURITY. HAVING THE RESOURCES TO OBTAIN NECESSARY FOOD IS CRITICAL TO REDUCING HUNGER AND FOOD INSECURITY. IN FACT, FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES ARE THE DETERMINING FACTOR FOR MANY FOOD PROGRAMS, INCLUDING FOOD STAMPS AND FREE AND REDUCED LUNCHES FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. NOT HAVING THE RESOURCES TO OBTAIN FOOD IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS PEOPLE SKIP MEALS AND SLIP FROM FOOD INSECURITY INTO HUNGER. THIS IS WHY CONNECTING RSVP VOLUNTEERS WITH MEANINGFUL WAYS TO SERVE IS SO VITAL. 
AT THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR GRANT, WE ANTICIPATE THAT RECRUITING AND PLACING VOLUNTEERS IN THESE AREAS WILL HELP INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS HUNGER AND FOOD INSECURITY ISSUES. RSVP VOLUNTEERS WILL ENABLE THESE ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS MEALS-ON-WHEELS PROGRAMS, FOOD BANKS, FOOD PANTRIES AND COMMUNITY GARDENS TO INCREASE FOOD SECURITY AND REDUCE HUNGER IN SKAGIT COUNTY.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,M,NONPROFIT WITH 501C3 IRS STATUS (OTHER THAN AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION),2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,2018-11-27 03:59:43.489317+00
