CDC: Two-Thirds of Individuals With Cancer Live at Least Five Years >

Details of Lung Cancer Vaccine

The lung cancer vaccine, called Cimavax, was developed more than 25 years ago by Cuba's Center for Molecular Immunology. Cuba's Ministry of Health then released it to the public at no cost in 2011, with each shot of the vaccine costing the government about $1 (Wired, 5/11).

Cimavax does not cure or prevent lung cancer (""Morning Mix,"" Washington Post, 5/12). Rather than combatting tumors directly, it works to keep tumors from metastasizing and growing, which can make a late-stage growth more manageable.

A 2008 Phase II trial of Cimavax found that individuals with lung cancer who received the medication lived four to six months longer on average than those who did not.

Agreement Details

As part of the agreement, CMI agreed to provide Roswell Park with all documentation about Cimavax necessary for an FDA application. Roswell Park CEO Candace Johnson said she would like to receive approval to begin testing the vaccine in the U.S. in the next six to eight months and begin clinical trials in one year.

Roswell Park officials said they intend to evaluate whether the vaccine could be used as a preventive measure. Cuba had not tested Cimavax's preventive capabilities mostly because of financial reasons, according to Wired (Wired, 5/11).

Dr. Richard Pazdur, head of FDA's Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, said such targeting of proteins cancer cells' surface has led to important new cancer treatments.

The FDA granted accelerated approval based on two studies showing Darzalex reduced the size of or eliminated tumors in about one-third of patients.

In one study, 29 percent of the 106 participants responded to Darzalex for 7.4 months, on average, before tumor growth resumed. In the other study, which included 42 patients, 36 percent had their tumors reduced or eliminated. Janssen is conducting further testing.

The biologic drug — produced in living cells rather than by mixing chemicals together — was approved for use in patients who have received three prior types of therapy and either didn't respond or relapsed after initial treatment, as is common with many cancer therapies. Patients in the studies had failed five treatments, on average.

""Darzalex gives people who have limited or no remaining options ... a real chance,"" Janssen said in a statement.

The infused drug is administered once weekly for the first two months and, if the patient continues responding, every two weeks for the next four months and then once per month. Each infusion has a list price of $5,850, according to Janssen, so for patients responding to Darzalex, 23 treatments over one year would cost $134,550. That's before any discounts insurers or other payers negotiate with J&J.

Darzalex can reduce levels of red blood cells that carry oxygen through the body, infection-fighting white blood cells and platelets needed for blood clotting. It should not be taken by pregnant women. The most common side effects reported were nausea, fatigue, pain in the back or infusion site, fever and cough.

Cystic fibrosis is a rare genetic disease that is caused by defective or missing CFTR proteins resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. The defective or missing proteins result in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cell in a number of organs, including the lungs.

Funding for the establishment, operation and growth of the GHVCI will come from Sanofi and the Gates Foundation, and additional funding will be sought to support collaborative research activities with respect to specific vaccines to be developed at the GHVCI.

This distinctive collaboration leverages the potential power of the partners' collective expertise, combining IDRI's vaccine design, formulation and production technologies; Sanofi's position as a leading multi-national vaccine developer, manufacturer and seller; and the Gates Foundation's knowledge, influence and financial support regarding the discovery and development of global health interventions, including vaccines. A key component is the application of IDRI's vaccine adjuvant technologies and formulation expertise, which have been developed over the past few years with strong financial support from the Gates Foundation. These adjuvant technologies are uniquely designed to improve immune responses, broaden vaccine protection and significantly save costs by reducing the amount of vaccine needed.

According to the World Health Organisation, vaccines have greatly reduced the burden of infectious diseases, including death tolls, disability and inequity, making ""formerly fearsome"" diseases a rarity in many parts of the world.

""History has shown us that vaccines are one of the best ways to improve public health, but in today's world, we are faced with a newly emerging infectious diseases, as well as age-old threats, that either have no vaccines or vaccines that are not effective,"" said Steven G. Reed, Ph.D., founder, president and chief scientific officer for IDRI.

""Combining that with the speed with which infectious diseases can travel the world, we need a new model for vaccine development, one that enables us to rapidly produce vaccines at a lower cost. The blend of the Gates Foundation's knowledge of global health and Sanofi's depth of vaccine development expertise is a perfect match for IDRI's unique technologies and research and development engine, allowing us to take a new approach to vaccine development.""

A Joint Steering Committee, comprised of representatives from each of the three partners, will mutually identify areas of research to discover, evaluate and develop novel human vaccines, as well as adjuvant/formulation platforms for the rapid response to emerging pathogens, that can prevent or treat infectious diseases.

Initial funding will be used to establish and operate the GHVCI, build capacity as the collaboration grows, and provide management and scientific recruitment as well as training.

""We are excited to be involved in this novel partnership and proud of the confidence shown in IDRI's technology and our science team's expertise by these two powerhouses, Sanofi and the Gates Foundation,"" said Erik Iverson, IDRI's president, business and operations.

(NASDAQ: ETRM) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved VBLOC vagal blocking therapy, delivered via the Maestro System, for the treatment of adult patients with obesity who have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of at least 40 to 45 kg/m2, or a BMI of at least 35 to 39.9 kg/m2 with a related health condition such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels, and who have tried to lose weight in a supervised weight management program within the past five years. The Maestro System is the first new medical device to be approved by the FDA for obesity in over ten years. EnteroMedics anticipates that the device will be available, on a limited basis, at select Bariatric Centers of Excellence in the U.S. this year. The Maestro System has received CE Mark and is listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.

""VBLOC Therapy offers an entirely new approach to the treatment of obesity,"" said Scott Shikora, MD, FACS, EnteroMedics' Chief Consulting Medical Officer. ""By blocking signals along the nerves that connect the brain and stomach, VBLOC to reduces feelings of hunger and promotes earlier feelings of fullness, which can help people with obesity reduce the number of calories consumed and promote safe, healthy and durable weight loss.""

The Maestro System is a pacemaker-like device that is implanted, usually in an outpatient procedure, to control both hunger and fullness by intermittently blocking the primary nerve which regulates the digestive system, the vagus nerve. VBLOC Therapy does not surgically alter or restrict the digestive system, does not create barriers to prevent absorption of nutrients and is completely reversible, allowing patients to lose weight without lifestyle compromises.

Information about the Maestro System and VBLOC Therapy

Approval of the Maestro Rechargeable System was based on the ReCharge Study, a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Maestro Rechargeable System in treating obesity. In an intention to treat (ITT) analysis of the study results, VBLOC-treated patients achieved 24.4% excess weight loss (EWL) at 12 months. At 18 months, VBLOC-treated patients maintained a 23.5% EWL. In a responder analysis of the ITT population at 12 months, over 50% of VBLOC-treated patients achieved 20% or greater EWL.

The SAE (severe adverse event) rate, defined as the proportion of subjects in the VBLOC treated group who experienced an implant/revision procedure, device or therapy-related SAE through 12 months post-implant, was 3.7% (n=6; 95% CI: 1.4% to 7.9%) in the ITT population. The most common (>10%) non-serious adverse events related to device, implant/revision procedure or therapy were pain at the neuroregulator site, and transient sensations of therapy such as heartburn/dyspepsia.

VBLOC Therapy is contraindicated for use in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, portal hypertension, esophageal varices or an uncorrectable, clinically significant hiatal hernia; patients for whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or diathermy use is planned; patients at high risk for surgical complications; and patients who have a permanently implanted, electrical-powered medical device or gastrointestinal device or prosthesis (e.g. pacemakers, implanted defibrillators, neurostimulators).

According to the CDC, more than one-third of U.S. adults live with obesity1. The estimated annual cost of obesity in the U.S. was $147 billion in 2008, accounting for more than twice previous estimates, approximately 21 percent, of U.S. healthcare costs.,2,3. Higher BMI is a major risk factor for over 70 comorbidities associated with obesity, such as cardiovascular disease which was the leading cause of death in 2012, diabetes, hypertension, musculoskeletal disorders and some cancers4.

The other five announcements issued under PCORI's National Priorities for Research provide up to $88 million for a broad range of research projects, with a pool of $12 million of that total set aside for studies that focus on rare disease.

The HCV announcement is a product of a research prioritization process that included a large multi-stakeholder workshop that PCORI held in October 2014; PCORI's Board of Governors later approved the topic for development into a PFA. The announcement addresses four specific research questions addressing critical issues involving HCV screening and treatment options.

HCV is a major chronic condition that affects more than 3 million people in the U.S., the majority of whom are undiagnosed. About one-third of these individuals will develop chronic liver disease-including liver cancer-if left untreated.

""Hepatitis C is a substantial health threat that can have devastating consequences for infected people and their families,"" said PCORI Executive Director Joe Selby, MD, MPH. ""Recently approved medications are very promising and appear to be vast improvements over previous therapies, but as yet there's no 'real-world' evidence of their long-term effectiveness or comparative evidence on a number of critical research questions that should be answered to help patients and those who care for them make better-informed decisions.""

Rare disease research is called out as a particular area of interest in four of the five broad funding announcements issued today (the PFA seeking proposals for methods studies is excluded). PCORI is earmarking $12 million for studies that focus on rare diseases, which are defined as life-threatening and chronically debilitating conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people, or fewer than one in 1,500, in the United States.

PCORI's authorizing legislation calls for the institute to address rare diseases as part of its research agenda. Rare diseases also are the focus of about half of the Patient-Powered Research Networks that are part of PCORnet, PCORI's national patient-centered health data initiative designed to allow the nation to conduct clinical research faster and more efficiently.

""We recognize the special challenges and efforts needed to study rare diseases effectively, so we've added a call for rare disease-focused projects across our broad funding announcements,"" Selby said. ""We're hoping to solicit studies that can gather the amounts of data needed to conduct comparative effectiveness research studies and produce useful information about how to better care for people with these conditions.""

Applicants can also learn about PCORI's application process through informational ""town hall"" webinars that are designed to help them meet all criteria for each funding announcement.

Letters of Intent (LOIs) for the Clinical Management of Hepatitis C Infection and five broad PFAs, including rare disease research proposals, are due by 5 p.m. ET Friday, March 6, 2015.

We look forward to finding solutions to address this public healthcare problem together with the FDA.""

EXPAREL is currently indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. The product combines bupivacaine with DepoFoam, a proven product delivery technology that delivers medication over a desired time period. EXPAREL represents the first and only multivesicular liposome local anesthetic that can be utilized in the peri- or postsurgical setting. By utilizing the DepoFoam platform, a single dose of EXPAREL delivers bupivacaine over time, providing significant reductions in cumulative pain scores with a 45 percent decrease in opioid consumption; the clinical benefit of the opioid reduction was not demonstrated. Additional information is available at: (www.EXPAREL.com).

Important Safety Information

EXPAREL is contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. EXPAREL has not been studied for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Non-bupivacaine-based local anesthetics, including lidocaine, may cause an immediate release of bupivacaine from EXPAREL if administered together locally. The administration of EXPAREL may follow the administration of lidocaine after a delay of 20 minutes or more. Other formulations of bupivacaine should not be administered within 96 hours following administration of EXPAREL. Monitoring of cardiovascular and neurological status, as well as vital signs should be performed during and after injection of EXPAREL as with other local anesthetic products. Because amide-type local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolized by the liver, EXPAREL should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater-than or equal to 10%) following EXPAREL administration were nausea, constipation, and vomiting.

""Today's approval gives a new option to these patients and providers.""

As many as 35 million adult Americans may experience IBS, and 40% of people with IBS suffer from diarrhea-prominent symptoms that include urgency, loose, watery stools and abdominal pain.i,ii,iii Although millions suffer from the condition, current treatments for IBS-D are limited to products aimed at relieving individual symptoms (e.g., antispasmodics, anti-diarrheal agents, bulking agents, anti-flatulence agents) and fail to address the syndrome complex.

""The Xifaxan 550 mg approval gives patients access to a treatment that may alleviate their symptoms,"" said Dr. Costas H. Kefalas, president and member of the Board of Directors of the Digestive Disease National Coalition (DDNC). ""This treatment is in line with the DDNC's mission to provide improved access to quality digestive health care.""

The FDA approval was based on data from three clinical studies of more than 3,000 patients. Results of TARGET 1 and 2 showed patients treated with Xifaxan 550 mg achieved relief of the FDA composite endpoint (stool consistency and abdominal pain) versus placebo. TARGET 3 showed that patients who responded to treatment with Xifaxan 550 mg but experienced recurrent symptoms responded to repeat treatment in the FDA composite endpoint versus placebo.

""We are thrilled to offer patients this new option to manage their IBS-D symptoms,"" said Bill Forbes, PharmD, president, medical, R&D; and chief development officer of Salix. ""The FDA approval in IBS-D extends the reach of Xifaxan 550 mg beyond hepatic encephalopathy to a population greatly in need of a different treatment approach.""

Xifaxan 550 mg offers a safety and tolerability profile comparable to placebo when used as directed.

Xifaxan is also FDA-approved to manage hepatic encephalopathy (550 mg). Recommended dosing for Xifaxan 550 mg for IBS-D is one 550 mg tablet three times a day for 14 days. Patients can take up to two additional courses if IBS-D symptoms recur in the future. Xifaxan 550 mg is currently available to patients.

Up to approximately 58% of these ulcers may become infected. Published data demonstrates that the current standard of care for diabetic foot infections (DFIs) with systemic antibiotics has a 30-50% failure rate. Failure of treatment can lead to significantly increased risk of hospitalization and often to the need for amputation resulting in increased costs to the healthcare system and a much higher risk of mortality for patients. We believe that Cogenzia has the potential to be the first topical antibiotic approved as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of DFIs and that it could significantly improve upon the current cure success rate.

Cogenzia acts in conjunction with systemic antibiotics and standard wound care to provide high concentrations of gentamicin directly to the site of DFIs. These concentrations are not normally possible with systemic gentamicin treatment due to the risk of side effects. In the Cogenzia Phase 2 program, data demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the clinical cure rate when compared to systemic antibiotics and wound care alone. In the Phase 2 study, 100% of Cogenzia-treated subjects experienced a clinical cure compared to 70% for the control group.

Its lead molecule is a recombinant human protein derived from mannose binding lectin (MBL) fused to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin (FcMBL). When Opsonix's FcMBL is attached to the membrane of a dialyzer-type device, it can remove a broad range of bacteria, fungi, parasites, viruses, and toxins responsible for initiating the sepsis cascade, including antibiotic-resistant organisms. Opsonix's pathogen-extracting therapy has been designed to work in synergy with conventional antibiotic treatments.

""Opsonix's pathogen-extracting therapy provides a novel therapeutic solution leveraging the broad binding activities of a natural human protein that may rapidly remove sepsis-causing pathogens - and the toxins they release - from a patient's blood,"" said Eric Devroe, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Opsonix. ""With our FcMBL-based pathogen-extracting therapy, treatment of blood-borne infectious disease can be initiated earlier in the course of infection, when it is most needed, without having to wait to identify the disease-causing pathogen. With the strong support of our investors and a compelling body of evidence developed by our scientific founders, Opsonix will move forward expeditiously with preclinical studies to advance our pathogen-extracting therapy.""

Opsonix's pathogen-capture proteins are engineered versions of human blood opsonins - molecular components of the innate immune system that help to clear pathogens and the toxins they release. The company develops therapeutic products by applying recombinant protein engineering to harness the unique binding properties of opsonins that enable them to clear a broad range of infectious microbes and toxic components from blood, which can stimulate the inflammatory cascade that leads to sepsis.

In studies conducted and published by Opsonix's scientific founders at Harvard University's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, FcMBL-based pathogen-extracting therapies have been shown to work in synergy with conventional antibiotics, as well as to clear blood of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Hence, Opsonix's sepsis therapy has the potential to be used not only in combination with existing antibiotics, but also to treat patients when conventional therapeutic options are not available.

Leadership Science and Founding Team

Opsonix's scientific founders, Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., and Michael Super, Ph.D., carried out the original protein engineering and initial design and experimental validation of the FcMBL-enabled pathogen-extracting therapy at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. Ingber and Super are pioneers in translating innovative design principles into healthcare products. They are also co-principal investigators on a project for sepsis treatment funded by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Dialysis-Like Therapeutics Program, which led to the technology that Opsonix is commercializing.

Prior to being appointed Chief Executive Officer of Opsonix, founder Eric Devroe, Ph.D. worked closely with Ingber and Super as an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at the Wyss Institute where he developed the company's product development, business, and fundraising strategy. He brings more than 15 years of experience in the life sciences, including roles in venture capital, business development, and as a founding team member of multiple start-up companies.

Opsonix has an exclusive, worldwide license to intellectual property from Harvard University covering the use of engineered opsonin proteins in pathogen-extracting devices and companion diagnostics, and it is uniquely positioned to advance this technology into therapeutic products for the benefit of millions of sepsis patients worldwide.

A key component of the program is a patient app developed by Geisinger that allows certain surgery patients enrolled in the pilot to determine the amount of the refund they want based on their co-pay.

For example, if a spine surgery patient paid a $1,000 co-pay and they weren't pleased with how office staff treated them, they can log into the app and select from a sliding scale how much of their co-pay they want refunded. They can choose from $1 to $1,000 and the refund request is processed within 3 to 5 business days.

Feinberg doesn't anticipate the system will be abused and instead foresees patients sticking to the honor system.

""Ultimately, they just want to be acknowledged and to spare other families any pain they might have experienced,"" he said.

""We've been held up as a national model for providing both high-quality and cost-effective medical care and our ProvenCare program has garnered national - and international - praise for eliminating unwarranted variation and applying scientific best practices. Now is the time to focus on compassion.""

ProvenExperience, he predicts, will transform the health care industry once again.

""In the beginning, I talked to other health system CEOs and industry leaders about ProvenExperience and they all said, 'Don't do it.' I really felt dejected,"" Feinberg explained.

Basic blood/urine investigations, cortisol and thyroid profile were normal except for low blood glucose and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 1.4 mg/dL and creatinine clearance 42 mL/min). HbA1c was 6.8% (4.4%-6.4%), insulin 51.3 U/mL (2.6-24.9 U/mL), IGF-1 301 ng/mL(27-223 ng/mL), and C peptide 9.3 ng/mL (0.8-3.5 ng/mL). These levels were elevated but were deemed nondiagnostic because of fluctuating glucose values after glucagon administration. A blood screen for sulfonylureas and metaglinides was negative.

More specifically, the present invention relates to situin modulating stilbenoids, in specific orally bioavailable SIRT-1 enhancing compounds (i) 3,5-dimethoxy-3,4'-dihydroxystilbene and (ii) 2,3',5',6-tetrahydroxy-trans-stilbene, and compositions thereof. The present invention also discusses the novel enhanced anti-acne properties of 3,5-dimethoxy-3,4'-dihydroxystilbene and compositions thereof.

""SIRT1 is a member of the sirtuin family of NAD.sup.+-dependent deacetylases. SIRT1 is an enzyme which deacetylates proteins that contribute to cellular regulation (reaction to stressors, longevity). These enzymes have evolved to catalyze a unique reaction in which deacetylation of a lysine residue in a substrate protein is coupled to the consumption of NAD. The following prior art references discuss the biological nature and activity of SIRT1.

Imai, S., Armstrong, C. M., Kaeberlein, M. & Guarente, L. Transcriptional silencing and longevity protein Sir2 is an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase. Nature 403, 795-800 (2000)].

""The modulation of the activities of cellular protein substrates including PGC-1.alpha., NCoR, p300, NFkB, FOXO, and p53 has been attributed to the biological effects of the enzyme on mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolism in muscle and adipose tissue, and cellular survival. Activation of SIRT1 protein results in improvement of insulin sensitivity, lower glucose levels; Thus SIRT1 inhibition has direct bearing on diabetic control, SIRT1 activation results in the increase in the number of mitochondria and improvement of their function.

The first cohort of patients to be enrolled in the planned clinical trial will be enrolled in a traditional dose escalation regimen to assess safety and determine the optimal dose of the antibody. A second patient cohort will establish the safety and optimized dose of the antibody when administered with standard of care chemotherapy and a third patient cohort will be administered the optimized dose of antibody as a single agent for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer.

David Hansen, MabVax's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""The filing of the first of two planned INDs for our novel HuMab 5B1 antibody is a significant achievement for MabVax. Pending FDA acceptance of the IND, we will begin the dose escalation portion of this Phase I trial as early in 2016 as possible and anticipate reporting on the early safety assessment and determination of a maximum tolerated dose in mid-year 2016. Achievement of this important interim milestone will enable us to move into the combination therapy and monotherapy portions of the trial where we could learn much more about the pharmacological effects of this new therapy. The milestone could also have a positive impact on our future commercial and corporate development activities. We currently anticipate having full enrollment of all three patient cohorts sometime before the end of 2016.""

MabVax plans to file a second IND application this month for its HuMab 5B1-based PET imaging agent and, subject to FDA acceptance, will begin this Phase I trial as early as possible in 2016. When the antibody is combined with a radio-label as a novel PET imaging agent, the (89)Zr-HuMab 5B1 product has demonstrated high image resolution of tumors in established xenograft animal models, making it attractive as a potential companion diagnostic for the HuMab 5B1 therapeutic product.

""We believe the data generated in the early portions of these two Phase I trials will help demonstrate the initial safety, targeting specificity, and utility of the HuMab 5B1 antibody in this devastating disease,"" added Mr. Hansen. ""We are excited about the potential applicability of our dual-product development approach in other cancers with HuMab 5B1, as well as with follow-on antibodies under development at MabVax.""

Rather than mount patent challenges in the courts, Munshi says he plans to wait out existing lawsuits to see where the courts come down on allowing biosimilars. Among the court battles being closely watched are those between Amgen and Sandoz and a challenge to Johnson & Johnson brought by South Korean biotech Celltrion, he said.

The wait-and-see approach makes sense for a small company like his, which was formed last year through  a merger with Zalicus, a Cambridge-based developer of painkillers. Epirus today has just over 30 employees, with 25 of them located in its Boylston Street headquarters, and Munshi said it's not a wise use of his limited resources to mount expensive legal challenges in order to be the first to get a generic on the market.

""I think that it's important that we don't have to be the first,"" he said. ""We just want to be among the first wave.""

Epirus plans to file for approval of its first drug in the U.S. starting in 2017, a generic version of the arthritis drug, Remicade. The following year, it will file for a generic Humira and in 2019, for a generic of Actemra. It will simultaneously file for approval in Europe for those drugs.

But in the meantime, Munshi says half the global market for biosimilars lie outside the U.S., meaning there are plenty of regions where his company plans to compete. The generic Remicade, in fact, already earned approval in India last year, and Munshi said that Latin America, southeast Asia and a handful of other regions have already been identified as target areas for its drugs.

The fact that all its drugs are in the same general field of inflammation means that it can have the same sales teams for all of them, increasing efficiency in the long run.

Indeed, the articled led to a pre-market drop of 3 percent in Vertex's stock price.

However, the stock quickly regained the losses and by 10:30 a.m. was up 3 percent as analysts weighed in to say the documents actually appear to support approval of the drug. In particular, RBC Capital analyst Michael Yee  said in a research note this morning that ""we believe the FDA is just trying to ask the panel 'if' the evidence is enough to show that combo (of lumacaftor and Kalydeco) benefit is significantly better or proven better than (Kalydeco) alone,"" but says studies show that the combination ""definitely"" is better than either drug alone.

""Importantly, we think this is unlikely to block approval as Vertex has run major Phase 3 studies showing statistically significant, clinically meaningful differences...,"" he wrote. ""It's possible that VRTX would have to do some ""follow-up"" studies to show it's ""better"" than mono but this is unlikely to block approval.""

If anything, the market's reaction this morning underscores the attention being paid to approval of the drug, which will play a critical role in the future of the state's second-largest biotech firm. If approved, the drug will expand the number of patients able to be treated by Vertex drugs from around 2,000 in the U.S. to more than 10,000, as lumacaftor works in a far more common gene mutation thjat Kalydeco is approved for.

IMLYGIC is a ""big deal,"" said Brown Cancer Center deputy director Dr. Jason Chesney, because it's ""the first time that a virus has been approved for the treatment of cancer.""

Louisville Business First reported on Chesney's immunotherapy work as part of its  ""Cutting Edge Cancer Care"" package earlier this month.

The Amgen therapy involves injecting a melanoma tumor with an ""oncolytic virus"" — in this case, a version of the herpes virus that has been engineered to activate the body's immune system to attack cancer cells while not causing the patient to contract the virus.

The IMLYGIC oncolytic virus ""causes the tumor to rupture and die,"" releasing antigens that may help trigger the body's immune system to fight future tumors, according to the Amgen news release.

The virus treatment was tested in Louisville and other locations as part of a study by Amgen, a California-based biotechnology company that owns a distribution facility in Louisville at 12000 Plantside Drive. The study enrolled 436 patients as part of the company's application for FDA approval, said Amgen director of corporate affairs Kelley Davenport.

Chesney said he has seen patients respond to IMLYGIC whose cancer still progressed when treated with other, already FDA-approved drugs.

That's why he thinks the new approval ""means that lives will be saved,"" he said. And the treatment could be used for other cancer types. Another study is being planned for metastases from breast, lung, kidney, colon and other cancers.

Immunotherapy drugs are expected to lead to $20 billion to $40 billion in annual U.S. sales by 2020, according to a Barron's story, citing analysts.

But the new drug offering isn't expected to do much for Amgen's overall earnings. According to Forbes, citing biotech analyst Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Co., the drug may bring in a high of only about $200 million a year in sales. The company posts about $20 billion in annual sales, according to Forbes.

But it is an important step in cancer care, Dr. Sean E. Harper, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen, said in the release.

""Not all melanoma patients currently benefit from available therapies, and IMLYGIC represents an important new option that can provide meaningful durable responses for patients with this aggressive and complex disease,"" he said.

And while lots of biotech companies have been working on similar treatments, Amgen is the first to market it, Forbes reported. Amgen entered the oncolytic virus arena in 2011, when it spent a total of $1 billion to buy IMLYGIC's inventor, Biovex Inc., which now manufactures the therapy, according to the Forbes story.

The panel voted 10 to 4 in support of approval for progressive keratoconus with 1 abstention and 6 to 4 in support of approval for corneal ectasia following refractive surgery with 4 abstentions and 1 member not voting. The FDA is not required to follow the recommendation of the panel, though it usually considers the recommendation when making its decision on approval of the product.

""We are pleased with the panel recommendation, which represents an important milestone toward making this innovative therapeutic treatment available to patients with either keratoconus or corneal ectasia following refractive surgery,"" said David Muller, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer for Avedro. ""We appreciate the opportunity to present our comprehensive findings and look forward to continuing discussions with the FDA as their review of the NDA continues.""

The Avedro NDA submission encompasses data from three prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, placebo-controlled, 12-month trials conducted in the United States to determine the safety and effectiveness of certain riboflavin ophthalmic solutions used in conjunction with UVA irradiation for performing corneal cross-linking in eyes with progressive keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. Avedro's KXL System, used in combination with riboflavin ophthalmic solutions, received orphan drug designation for both keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery, which may provide the Company with up to seven years of market exclusivity for the KXL System and certain riboflavin ophthalmic solutions for those indications, if approved.

The PDUFA goal date for the NDA is March 29, 2015.

Approximately 70% to 80% cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy exhibit side-effects such as nausea and vomiting. The approved medications for managing CINV include Aloxi (palonosetron), Zofran (ondansetron), Kytril (granisetron), and Emend (aprepitant). The first fixed-dose combination oral agent 'Akynzeo' (netupitant-palonosetron) for prevention of CINV was approved in October 2014 by the USFDA. The CINV drugs market's growth is predicted to be driven by the expected approval of two key pipeline drugs, namely, rolapitant and SUSTOL (APF-530). Additionally, rise in the number of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy will be a major growth driver for this market.

Request Sample: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=776

The report covers several market size and forecasts for drugs such as Zofran generic, Aloxi, Emend, Kytril generic, SUSTOL (extended release granisetron injection), Akynzeo, and rolapitant. Considering 2013 as the base year for calculations, the CINV drugs report provides growth strategies, recent developments, and in-depth forecasts of the CINV drugs market from 2014 to 2020.

The CINV drugs report also discusses how patent expiry of leading drugs and approval of the pipeline drugs affects the growth of this market.

Performed at John Muir Medical Center, Concord, percutaneous mitral valve repair, or MitraClip, has been approved for U.S. patients with severe symptomatic degenerative MR who are at prohibitive risk for open heart, mitral valve surgery. Physicians at John Muir Health successfully performed their first MitraClip procedure on June 11 and have a number of procedures slated in the coming weeks.

Degenerative MR is caused by an anatomic defect of the mitral valve of the heart. It's a debilitating, progressive and life-threatening disease in which a leaky mitral valve causes a backward flow of blood in the heart. MR is common, affecting more than 4 million Americans -- nearly one in 10 people aged 75 and above.(1) The condition can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats, stroke, and heart failure.

Open heart mitral valve surgery is the gold standard treatment, but many patients are at prohibitive risk for the invasive procedure based on certain factors, such as age and physical condition. Medications for the condition are limited to symptom management and do not stop the progression of the disease.

Abbott Vascular's MitraClip procedure repairs the mitral valve without the need for open heart surgery. The device is delivered to the heart through the femoral vein, a blood vessel in the leg, and once implanted, allows the heart to pump blood more efficiently, thereby relieving symptoms and improving patient quality of life. Patients undergoing MitraClip treatment typically experience short recovery times and short hospital stays, which are generally less than 48 hours.

The John Muir Health MitraClip team is comprised of cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons, who work closely together to screen and perform the MitraClip procedure on those patients that will benefit greatly from this life-enhancing treatment. They include cardiologists Andrew Dublin, M.D., Faizul Haque, M.D., Paul McWhirter, M.D., Howard Min, M.D. and Perkin Shiu, M.D. and cardiovascular surgeons Murali Dharan, M.D. and Jatinder Dhillon, M.D.

Multiple trials, published reports, and registries of patients treated with the MitraClip device consistently demonstrate its safety, reduction in MR, improvement in symptoms, and reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure, even in some of the most severely ill and debilitated patients. More than 20,000 patients around the world have been treated with the MitraClip device.

About XR--ODT Technology

Stimulant medications such as methylphenidate and amphetamine are the standard of care for treating ADHD, and XR formulations of these medications allow for once--daily dosing. However, recent data suggest that a significant percentage of the pediatric population have difficulty swallowing solid dosage forms, and many remain uncomfortable doing so into adulthood.

About Neos Therapeutics

Neos Therapeutics, Inc. is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing products utilizing its proprietary modified--release drug delivery technology platform. The Company is initially focusing on ADHD and has developed three branded product candidates that are XR medications in patient--friendly ODT or liquid suspension dosage forms.

About XR--ODT Technology

Stimulant medications such as methylphenidate and amphetamine are the standard of care for treating ADHD, and XR formulations of these medications allow for once--daily dosing. However, recent data suggest that a significant percentage of the pediatric population have difficulty swallowing solid dosage forms, and many remain uncomfortable doing so into adulthood. Orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) differ from traditional tablets and capsules in that they are designed to disintegrate on the tongue without the need for water, rather than being swallowed whole.

About Neos Therapeutics

Neos Therapeutics, Inc. is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing products utilizing its proprietary modified--release drug delivery technology platform. The Company is initially focusing on ADHD and has developed three branded product candidates that are XR medications in patient--friendly ODT or liquid suspension dosage forms. In addition, Neos manufactures and markets its generic equivalent of the branded product Tussionex, an XR liquid suspension of hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine indicated for the relief of cough and upper respiratory symptoms of a cold.

135,7/24/2019 11:28:57,BWR0000020151030ebau0000k,1,1.0,1.0,KattampallilNeil,KattampallilNeil,,Yes,Approved by FDA and scheduled to be launched,"Utibron Neohaler, Seebri Neohaler",Sosei Group Corporation,Yes,No,No,"Sosei Group Corporation (TOKYO:4565) confirms today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the new Novartis dual combination bronchodilator Utibron(TM) Neohaler(R) (indacaterol 27.5 mcg/glycopyrrolate 15.6 mcg) inhalation powder for the long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. The FDA also approved Seebri(TM) Neohaler(R) (glycopyrrolate) inhalation powder 15.6 mcg -- which is one component of Utibron Neohaler -- as a stand-alone monotherapy for COPD. Sosei is eligible to receive milestone payments of 22.5 million dollars for approval of both products.

COPD is a progressive and life-threatening lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe(1) . Nearly 27 million people in the US are affected by COPD(2) , which ranks as the third leading cause of death in the US(3,4) and is a major cause of serious long-term disability(5) .

Utibron Neohaler and Seebri Neohaler are expected to become available in the first quarter of 2016.

The FDA's decision to approve Utibron Neohaler is based on results of the phase III EXPEDITION trial program, which included 2,654 patients with COPD and consisted of two 12-week efficacy studies (FLIGHT 1 & 2) and one 52-week safety study (FLIGHT 3)(6) .

In the efficacy studies, Utibron Neohaler demonstrated superior and sustained improvements in lung function (FEV(1) AUC(0-12) )(6) at week 12, compared to its individual bronchodilator components (indacaterol 27.5 mcg and glycopyrrolate 15.6 mcg) as well as placebo, all dosed twice-daily(6) . Improvements in lung function were seen compared to placebo at 5 minutes after the first dose and sustained through the 12 hour dosing interval(6) .

Utibron Neohaler also showed clinically meaningful improvements in health-related quality of life and reduced use of rescue medication compared to placebo(6) . Health status was assessed using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)(6) total score, which is a composite of symptoms, activities and impact on daily living.

Long-acting beta(2) -adrenergic agonists, such as indacaterol, one of the active ingredients in Utibron Neohaler, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Utibron Neohaler is not indicated for asthma and should not be initiated in acutely deteriorating COPD patients or for the relief of acute symptoms. The most common adverse reactions seen in the efficacy studies (incidence greater than or equal to 1% and higher than placebo) were sore throat, runny nose, high blood pressure and back pain(6) . Adverse reactions reported in the long-term safety trial were generally consistent with those observed in the 12-week studies(6) .

Utibron and Seebri are delivered via the low resistance Neohaler inhaler, which makes it suitable for patients with different severities of airflow limitation.

About Utibron Neohaler

Utibron Neohaler, previously known as QVA149, is a twice-daily fixed-dose combination of the long-acting beta(2) -adrenergic agonist (LABA) indacaterol 27.5 mcg and glycopyrrolate 15.6 mcg, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) approved in the US for the long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. Glycopyrrolate 15.6 mcg is the active ingredient of Seebri Neohaler. Utibron Neohaler is not indicated to treat asthma or for the relief of sudden symptoms of COPD.

The FDA also approved Seebri(TM) Neohaler(R) (glycopyrrolate) inhalation powder 15.6 mcg -- which is one component of Utibron Neohaler -- as a stand-alone monotherapy for COPD. Sosei is eligible to receive milestone payments of 22.5 million dollars for approval of both products.

COPD is a progressive and life-threatening lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe(1) . Nearly 27 million people in the US are affected by COPD(2) , which ranks as the third leading cause of death in the US(3,4) and is a major cause of serious long-term disability(5) .

Utibron Neohaler and Seebri Neohaler are expected to become available in the first quarter of 2016.

The FDA's decision to approve Utibron Neohaler is based on results of the phase III EXPEDITION trial program, which included 2,654 patients with COPD and consisted of two 12-week efficacy studies (FLIGHT 1 & 2) and one 52-week safety study (FLIGHT 3)(6) .

In the efficacy studies, Utibron Neohaler demonstrated superior and sustained improvements in lung function (FEV(1) AUC(0-12) )(6) at week 12, compared to its individual bronchodilator components (indacaterol 27.5 mcg and glycopyrrolate 15.6 mcg) as well as placebo, all dosed twice-daily(6) . Improvements in lung function were seen compared to placebo at 5 minutes after the first dose and sustained through the 12 hour dosing interval(6) .

Utibron Neohaler also showed clinically meaningful improvements in health-related quality of life and reduced use of rescue medication compared to placebo(6) . Health status was assessed using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)(6) total score, which is a composite of symptoms, activities and impact on daily living.

Long-acting beta(2) -adrenergic agonists, such as indacaterol, one of the active ingredients in Utibron Neohaler, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Utibron Neohaler is not indicated for asthma and should not be initiated in acutely deteriorating COPD patients or for the relief of acute symptoms. The most common adverse reactions seen in the efficacy studies (incidence greater than or equal to 1% and higher than placebo) were sore throat, runny nose, high blood pressure and back pain(6) . Adverse reactions reported in the long-term safety trial were generally consistent with those observed in the 12-week studies(6) .

Utibron and Seebri are delivered via the low resistance Neohaler inhaler, which makes it suitable for patients with different severities of airflow limitation.

""That's a hard question,"" said Stephanie Bialek, a herpes virus expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""It's one we expect a lot of people to have. And one that cannot yet be answered because the new vaccine is still being studied, she said.

Shingles is related to chicken pox. After the itchy, unsightly blisters of chicken pox disappear, the varicella-zoster virus goes dormant in nerve cells.

Years or decades later, the virus erupts as shingles in a quarter of infected adults, more than a million a year. People who live to 85 have a 50-50 chance of developing the disease.

Exactly why the virus reactivates is unclear, but age-related declines in immune protection play a role because shingles usually occurs after age 50.

The Merck vaccine, Zostavax, was approved in 2006 for people age 50 and over, and is recommended for ages 60 and over. (Most insurers cover it at age 60.)

Zostavax, made with a weakened form of the herpes zoster virus, is less effective in older people -- those more likely to get the disease. It reduces shingles by 70 percent among those in their 50s, by 64 percent among people in their 60s, and by 38 percent among people 70 and older. It also reduces postherpetic neuralgia by about 67 percent in all groups and may lessen the severity of a shingles recurrence.

The international study of the shingles immunization, published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine, gave two doses of either the Glaxo vaccine or a placebo to 15,400 people age 50 and over. Only six vaccine recipients in the entire group developed shingles over the three-year follow-up, compared to 210 in the placebo group, making the vaccine about 97 percent effective.

An estimated 41% of persons aged 35 to 70 years have hypertension, which is associated with an increased risk of several cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases including stroke.

Antihypertensive medications are recommended for primary stroke prevention in patients with hypertension, and recent studies have suggested that B vitamin supplementation might also help reduce the risk of primary stroke in high risk patients (Stroke. 2010;41[6]:1205; Int J Clin Pract. 2012;66[6]:544).

A recent randomized trial compared enalapril 10 mg plus folic acid 0.8 mg vs. enalapril 10 mg alone for five years in 20,702 Chinese adults aged 45 to 75 years (mean age, 60 years) with hypertension. At enrollment, all patients had resting systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, or were taking antihypertensive medication. Other antihypertensive medications were used concomitantly during the trial by 57.1% of patients. Patients with a history of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, coronary revascularization, or congenital heart disease were excluded from the trial (CSPPT trial JAMA. 2015;313[13]:1325).

The trial was terminated early after a significant difference between groups in first stroke occurrence exceeding the predefined stopping rule was reached on the fourth interim analysis. Overall treatment adherence was low, with 69.1% of patients taking 70% or greater of all study. Most patients discontinuing treatment were still followed for outcome events, and all randomized patients were included in the primary analysis.

Median baseline folate level was 8.1 ng/mL, and at last follow-up the median increase in folate level was 11.2 ng/mL with enalapril plus folic acid vs. 4.4 ng/mL with enalapril alone (no P value reported). There were no significant differences in baseline or follow-up systolic or diastolic blood pressure measurements between groups.

Comparing enalapril plus folic acid vs. enalapril alone, first stroke occurred in 2.7% vs. 3.4% (P = 0.003, NNT 141) and ischemic stroke was reported in 2.2% vs. 2.8% (P = 0.002, NNT 167). Enalapril plus folic acid was also associated with a reduction in the composite outcome of stoke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death (3.1% vs. 3.9%, P = 0.002, NNT 125), but there was no significant difference between groups in rates of hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, all-cause death, or adverse events. A subgroup analysis by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T polymorphisms found no significant differences in rate of first stroke by genotype.

The results of this trial suggest that the addition of folic acid to enalapril may result in a small, but significant, decrease in primary stroke incidence among patients with hypertension. Although the magnitude of the reduction was small, adding folic acid to antihypertensive medication may be a cheap and easy way to further reduce the risk of stroke.

It is worth considering, however, that baseline folate levels of patients in this study may be lower than in places with folate fortification, thereby limiting the generalizability of this study.

An estimated 41% of persons aged 35 to 70 years have hypertension, which is associated with an increased risk of several cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases including stroke.

Antihypertensive medications are recommended for primary stroke prevention in patients with hypertension, and recent studies have suggested that B vitamin supplementation might also help reduce the risk of primary stroke in high risk patients (Stroke. 2010;41[6]:1205; Int J Clin Pract. 2012;66[6]:544).

A recent randomized trial compared enalapril 10 mg plus folic acid 0.8 mg vs. enalapril 10 mg alone for five years in 20,702 Chinese adults aged 45 to 75 years (mean age, 60 years) with hypertension. At enrollment, all patients had resting systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, or were taking antihypertensive medication. Other antihypertensive medications were used concomitantly during the trial by 57.1% of patients. Patients with a history of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, coronary revascularization, or congenital heart disease were excluded from the trial (CSPPT trial JAMA. 2015;313[13]:1325).

The trial was terminated early after a significant difference between groups in first stroke occurrence exceeding the predefined stopping rule was reached on the fourth interim analysis. Overall treatment adherence was low, with 69.1% of patients taking 70% or greater of all study. Most patients discontinuing treatment were still followed for outcome events, and all randomized patients were included in the primary analysis.

Median baseline folate level was 8.1 ng/mL, and at last follow-up the median increase in folate level was 11.2 ng/mL with enalapril plus folic acid vs. 4.4 ng/mL with enalapril alone (no P value reported). There were no significant differences in baseline or follow-up systolic or diastolic blood pressure measurements between groups.

Comparing enalapril plus folic acid vs. enalapril alone, first stroke occurred in 2.7% vs. 3.4% (P = 0.003, NNT 141) and ischemic stroke was reported in 2.2% vs. 2.8% (P = 0.002, NNT 167). Enalapril plus folic acid was also associated with a reduction in the composite outcome of stoke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death (3.1% vs. 3.9%, P = 0.002, NNT 125), but there was no significant difference between groups in rates of hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, all-cause death, or adverse events. A subgroup analysis by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T polymorphisms found no significant differences in rate of first stroke by genotype.

The results of this trial suggest that the addition of folic acid to enalapril may result in a small, but significant, decrease in primary stroke incidence among patients with hypertension. Although the magnitude of the reduction was small, adding folic acid to antihypertensive medication may be a cheap and easy way to further reduce the risk of stroke.

It is worth considering, however, that baseline folate levels of patients in this study may be lower than in places with folate fortification, thereby limiting the generalizability of this study. Also, although the relative contribution of MTHFR was examined, it is not clear whether the frequency of MTHFR polymorphisms are similar in other populations or if differences in overall population genetics would contribute more substantially to stroke risk.

The Honorable Sylvia Mathews Burwell Secretary

Department of Health and Human Services

200 Independence Ave SW

Washington, D.C. 20201

Dear Secretary Burwell:

As strong advocates for improving access to women's health care, we are writing to offer our support for the new guidance on the birth control benefit that aims to ensure insurers' compliance with the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) requirement to provide full coverage for all FDA-approved contraceptive methods with no copay.

Reducing unintended pregnancies through increased access to contraception is a worthy goal and we applaud the recent decision by HHS to include all FDA-approved methods of contraception as preventive services under the ACA. This important decision will allow women across the country to access their contraceptive of choice with no out-of-pocket cost other than their monthly premium.

In 2014, 67 percent of privately insured U. S. women accessed an oral contraceptive with no-copay, up from 15 percent in 2012, according to a Guttmacher Institute study published in the journal Contraception. Similar trends were seen with women using injectable contraceptives, rings, and IUDs. Studies have shown that when contraception is covered by insurance, women choose to use longer, more effective forms of contraception, experiencing fewer unplanned pregnancies as a result.

Although more women are now able to access contraception without a copay, insurers continue to create barriers. Some insurers are not covering all FDA-approved methods. Additionally, through the use of so-called ""reasonable medical management,"" insurers are restricting access to long-acting birth control and steering women away from accessing their contraceptive method of choice. Determining which method of contraception is right for a woman is a personal decision that should be made with her doctor.

We strongly support the newly-issued guidance to clarify the scope of the requirement and ensure that women have reliable and meaningful access to their contraceptive method of choice.

The Department of Health and Human Services should be closely monitoring and ensuring compliance with the law, and working with all stakeholders to reach that end.

Specifically, we request that you:

* Increase consumer education and awareness of the women's health benefits of the ACA, specifically contraception; and

* Proactively encourage states to properly enforce compliance, and ensure that local stakeholders and states develop plans of action for compliance.

We look forward to working with you on this issue to provide women with these crucial preventive services.

Several promising new drugs produced negative study results in clinical phase III trials. However, retrospective analysis of treatment response based on baseline pain phenotyping could demonstrate positive results for certain subgroups of patients. Thus, a prospective classification of patients according to pain phenotype may play an increasingly important role in personalized treatment of neuropathic pain states.""

According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""A recent prospective study using stratification based on pain-related sensory abnormalities confirmed the concept of personalized pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain.""

No. 4,151,042), as shown below:

""##STR00001##

""The naturally occurring and synthetic C-3 esters of maytansinol can be classified into two groups: (a) Maytansine (2) and its analogs (e.g., DM1 and DM4), which are C-3 esters with N-methyl-L-alanine or derivatives of N-methyl-L-alanine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,137,230; 4,260,608; 5,208,020; and Chem. Pharm. Bull. 12:3441 (1984)); (b) Ansamitocins, which are C-3 esters with simple carboxylic acids (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,248,870; 4,265,814; 4,308,268; 4,308,269; 4,309,428; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; and 4,331,598).

""Maytansine (2), its analogs and each of the ansamitocin species are C3 esters of maytansinol that can be prepared by esterification of maytansinol (1). U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,301,019 and 7,598,375 describe methods of acylating maytansinol (1), with an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid (NCA, 5), in the presence of a base to form an amino acid ester of maytansinol (May-AA, 6) as shown below:

""##STR00002##

""Amino acid esters of maytansinol are valuable intermediates that can be coupled to carboxylic acids to provide maytansinoids. For example, reaction of maytansinol with (4S)-3,4-dimethyl-2,5-oxazolidinedione (5a) forms N2'-deacetyl-maytansine (6a), which in turn can be coupled to 3-(methyldithio)propionic acid (7), using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) to form DM1-SMe (8) as shown below:

""##STR00003##

""A significant disadvantage of the acylation reaction that forms amino acid esters of maytansinol is that it also forms a by-product comprising an extra N-methyl-alanyl moiety in the C3 side chain, referred to as 'extra-NMA' (9). When N2'-deacetyl-maytansine is acylated, extra NMA (9) is also acylated to form extra NMA-DM1-SMe (9a). The structures of extra-NMA (9) and extra-NMA-DM1-SMe (9a) are shown below:

""##STR00004##

""DM1 (3) can be prepared from DM1-SMe (8) by reduction, which also converts any extra-NMA-DM1-SMe (9a) to extra-NMA-DM1 (10) as shown below:

""##STR00005##

""Extra-NMA-DM1 (10) is difficult to remove from DM1 (3) because both compounds have similar polarities and give overlapping peaks in the HPLC trace of purified DM1 (3). DM1 (3) and DM4 (4) are used to prepare antibody conjugates, several of which are currently in clinical trials.

""Thus, there is a need to improve the yield and robustness of the processes to prepare such maytansinoids and to minimize by-products formed during reactions used in their preparation.""

It has also been found that addition of a pre-quenching step with a nucleophile following the reaction of maytansinol and an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid substantially reduces formation of undesirable by-products, such as extra-NMA, as shown in Examples 6-8. Based on these discoveries, improved methods of preparing an amino acid ester of maytansinol are disclosed herein.

For example, reaction of maytansinol with (4S)-3,4-dimethyl-2,5-oxazolidinedione (5a) forms N2'-deacetyl-maytansine (6a), which in turn can be coupled to 3-(methyldithio)propionic acid (7), using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) to form DM1-SMe (8) as shown below:

""##STR00003##

""A significant disadvantage of the acylation reaction that forms amino acid esters of maytansinol is that it also forms a by-product comprising an extra N-methyl-alanyl moiety in the C3 side chain, referred to as 'extra-NMA' (9). When N2'-deacetyl-maytansine is acylated, extra NMA (9) is also acylated to form extra NMA-DM1-SMe (9a). The structures of extra-NMA (9) and extra-NMA-DM1-SMe (9a) are shown below:

""##STR00004##

""DM1 (3) can be prepared from DM1-SMe (8) by reduction, which also converts any extra-NMA-DM1-SMe (9a) to extra-NMA-DM1 (10) as shown below:

""##STR00005##

""Extra-NMA-DM1 (10) is difficult to remove from DM1 (3) because both compounds have similar polarities and give overlapping peaks in the HPLC trace of purified DM1 (3). DM1 (3) and DM4 (4) are used to prepare antibody conjugates, several of which are currently in clinical trials.

(Belmont, MA); Zhao, Robert Yongxin (Lexington, MA), filed on September 26, 2013, was published online on April 21, 2015.

Patent Issued for Methods for the Acylation of Maytansinol","ImmunoGen, Inc. Patent Issued for Methods for the Acylation of MaytansinolReporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""Maytansinoids are highly cytotoxic compounds, including maytansinol and C-3 esters of maytansinol (U.S. Pat. No. 4,151,042), as shown below:

""##STR00001##

""The naturally occurring and synthetic C-3 esters of maytansinol can be classified into two groups: (a) Maytansine (2) and its analogs (e.g., DM1 and DM4), which are C-3 esters with N-methyl-L-alanine or derivatives of N-methyl-L-alanine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,137,230; 4,260,608; 5,208,020; and Chem. Pharm. Bull. 12:3441 (1984)); (b) Ansamitocins, which are C-3 esters with simple carboxylic acids (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,248,870; 4,265,814; 4,308,268; 4,308,269; 4,309,428; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; and 4,331,598).

""Maytansine (2), its analogs and each of the ansamitocin species are C3 esters of maytansinol that can be prepared by esterification of maytansinol (1). U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,301,019 and 7,598,375 describe methods of acylating maytansinol (1), with an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid (NCA, 5), in the presence of a base to form an amino acid ester of maytansinol (May-AA, 6) as shown below:

""##STR00002##

""Amino acid esters of maytansinol are valuable intermediates that can be coupled to carboxylic acids to provide maytansinoids. For example, reaction of maytansinol with (4S)-3,4-dimethyl-2,5-oxazolidinedione (5a) forms N2'-deacetyl-maytansine (6a), which in turn can be coupled to 3-(methyldithio)propionic acid (7), using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) to form DM1-SMe (8) as shown below:

""##STR00003##

""A significant disadvantage of the acylation reaction that forms amino acid esters of maytansinol is that it also forms a by-product comprising an extra N-methyl-alanyl moiety in the C3 side chain, referred to as 'extra-NMA' (9). When N2'-deacetyl-maytansine is acylated, extra NMA (9) is also acylated to form extra NMA-DM1-SMe (9a). The structures of extra-NMA (9) and extra-NMA-DM1-SMe (9a) are shown below:

""##STR00004##

""DM1 (3) can be prepared from DM1-SMe (8) by reduction, which also converts any extra-NMA-DM1-SMe (9a) to extra-NMA-DM1 (10) as shown below:

""##STR00005##

""Extra-NMA-DM1 (10) is difficult to remove from DM1 (3) because both compounds have similar polarities and give overlapping peaks in the HPLC trace of purified DM1 (3). DM1 (3) and DM4 (4) are used to prepare antibody conjugates, several of which are currently in clinical trials.

""Thus, there is a need to improve the yield and robustness of the processes to prepare such maytansinoids and to minimize by-products formed during reactions used in their preparation.""

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""It has now been found that addition of a drying agent to the reaction between maytansinol and an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid substantially increases the yield of an amino acid ester of maytansinol, as shown in Examples 1-4. It has also been found that addition of a pre-quenching step with a nucleophile following the reaction of maytansinol and an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid substantially reduces formation of undesirable by-products, such as extra-NMA, as shown in Examples 6-8. Based on these discoveries, improved methods of preparing an amino acid ester of maytansinol are disclosed herein.

""A first embodiment of the invention is a method of preparing an amino acid ester of maytansinol represented by Formula (I):

""##STR00006## wherein R.sub.1 is hydrogen, an optionally substituted C1-C10 alkyl group or an amino acid side chain, provided that, if the amino acid side chain has a functional group, the functional group is optionally protected; and R.sub.2 is hydrogen or an optionally substituted C1-C10 alkyl group.

""The method comprises reacting maytansinol with an N-carboxyanhydride in a reaction mixture additionally comprising a base and a drying agent. The N-carboxyanhydride is represented by the following formula:

""##STR00007## All the variables in Formula (II) are as defined in Formula (I).

""A second embodiment of the invention is a method of preparing an amino acid ester of maytaninol represented by Formula (I), comprising: a) reacting maytansinol with an N-carboxyanhydride represented by Formula (II) in a reaction mixture additionally comprising a base; and b) reacting unreacted N-carboxyanhydride from step a) with a nucleophilic reagent.

In addition, we could discover a 1.3-fold higher pooled risk of higher MABP drop with a strong negative correlation (r = -0.935; r(2) = 0.89) and a 4.5-fold higher pooled risk of asystole during TCR under slight anesthesia compared with deeper anesthesia. Our work is the first systematic review about TCR and demonstrates clear evidence for TCR occurrence and a more severe course of the TCR in slight anesthesia underlying the importance of skills in anesthesia management during skull base surgery.""

Quantification measures included comet number (comet count) and the fraction of the ultrasound beams with comet findings (comet fraction). We used this algorithm in a pilot study in 20 stable dialysis outpatients to identify associations between ultrasound comets and clinical parameters including blood pressure (BP), percent blood volume reduction on dialysis (%BV), ejection fraction (EF), and ultrafiltration on dialysis (UF). Positive findings included associations with lung comet measurements with pre-dialysis Diastolic BP (r = 0.534, p = 0.015), subject age (r = -0.446, p = 0.049), and a combination of EF and end dialysis %BV reduction (r = -0.585, p = 0.028). Comet fraction and comet count were closely correlated due to the inherent relationship between these two metrics (r = 0.973, p< 0.001). Negative findings included ultrasound comets that did not change from beginning to end of dialysis (p = 0.756), and were not significantly correlated with single dialysis treatment UF (p = 0.522), subject body weight (p = 0.208), or BMI (p = 0.358). Ultrasound signal processing methods may help quantify lung ultrasound comets.""

According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Additional findings include algorithmic lung comet measurement that did not change significantly during single dialysis sessions in these stable outpatients, but were associated with cardiovascular and fluid status parameters.""

Lawmakers also approved a plan allowing private healthcare providers and other individuals to buy naloxone from pharmacies without a prescription - purchases that are now illegal. To do so, potential buyers must undergo free training by state health officials in administering the medicine.

Rep. Linda Campbell, D-Methuen, whose district has been hit hard by opiate overdoses, said the rising cost of naloxone is threatening lives. Many communities struggle to keep it in stock.

""We need to get the costs down so that communities that are dealing with this epidemic are able to purchase this life-saving medicine,"" she said.

Massachusetts reported more than 1,000 fatal overdoses in 2014, but state and local law enforcement officials say naloxone -- marketed under the brand name Narcan -- has saved hundreds of lives.

Narcan is a nasal spray that counteracts the effects of heroin, OxyContin and other painkillers by blocking certain receptors in the brain. The medicine, which has been used by first responders for decades, has a shelf life of 12 to 18 months.

In recent years, the cost of the drug has increased more than 100 percent — from $19.56 to $41.43 for a 2-milliliter dose, according to published reports. That has led to allegations by state officials of price gouging.

Attorney General Maura Healey, who in April launched an investigation into the skyrocketing price of the medicine, praised the bulk purchasing plan and said her office will contribute to the fund.

""Opiates now take more lives in our state than car accidents and guns combined,"" Healey said in a statement. ""Our office intends to make its own contributions to this fund and encourages other entities - both private and public - to do the same.""

The drug's manufacturer, California-based Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, attributes price increases to rising costs of materials, energy and labor. A company spokesman didn't respond to a call for comment.

The bulk purchasing program hinges on approval by Gov. Charlie Baker, whose administration is reviewing the budget.

Baker spokesman Billy Pitman noted that a municipal bulk purchasing program was among 65 recommendations by task force created by the Republican governor to address a rash of deaths from heroin and opiate overdoses. Baker supports the panel's recommendations, he said.

The report also calls for spending $35 million in the next three years on substance abuse treatment and prevention programs; heightened monitoring of prescription drugs; and required training for doctors in safe prescribing practices. It also calls for naming addiction specialists to state public health boards.

Gloucester Police Chief Leonard Campanello, whose department has been subsidizing the cost of Narcan for addicts who don't have insurance, said many police departments simply don't have the resources to get the best wholesale prices. He said the state has more leverage to bring down costs.

His department buys Narcan through a distributor at about $28 a dose, spending more than $12,000 a year. Every police cruiser, fire truck and ambulance is equipped with the life-saving medicine, he said.

Last year, Gloucester police officers, EMTs and firefighters used Narcan more than 60 times to reverse heroin or opioid overdoses, Campanello said. The individuals likely would have died without it, he said.

""These are unconscious people, some barely breathing, who've been brought back,"" Campanello said.

The state also needs to get to the root of the Narcan cost quandary, he said.

""We need to have conversations with the distributors about getting the prices down,"" he said. ""Narcan is not the answer, but it is saving lives, and we need to make sure it's affordable to those who need it.""

Under the deal, secured creditors Deerfield Special Situations Fund LP, RA Capital Healthcare Funds LP and Celgene Corp. (CELG) will assign $20.56 million in claims to the buyer in exchange for 25% of the aggregate membership interests in the buyer, a clinical-stage company developing regenerative products.

The buyer will acquire all the debtor's intellectual property and biological samples related to its trials housed at its Winston-Salem, N.C., headquarters. (Three employees have been regularly monitoring the headquarters, including responding to any alarms at the property.)

No other offers for the assets were submitted by the Friday sale hearing, according to Jeffrey Testa of McCarter & English LLP, counsel to Chapter 7 trustee Charles A. Stanziale Jr.

""We think it's a great result whenever a trustee can both save a business and be in a position to make a distribution to unsecured creditors, so we believe it's a win-win,"" Testa said. He added that 5% of the net sale proceeds will be set aside to fund a recovery to unsecured creditors.

Stanziale said the buyer intended to put up the money to continue the approval process for Tengion's regenerative medicine.

He said that process could cost ""in the tens of millions of dollars"" and estimated it could take up to three years. Keeping the patents alone costs $100,000 per month, Stanziale said.

Stanziale, who acknowledged the sale would not ""in my view come close to paying creditors,"" added: ""Is it a plus to have the research and [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval [process] go forward in what may be a breakthrough health remedy? That's a different story, and that's a good thing.""<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

He continued, ""So all of the time and the effort and the money that has been spent for research and approval will not go out the window.""

Stanziale said the buyer originally did not offer to include a credit bid component and only offered $600,000 cash, but he and his team ""talked them up significantly.""

The deal was scheduled to close Monday.

""It had to be done quickly because the research that was in cold storage needed to be attended to, and we couldn't take the risk of losing the currency on the patents and losing the frozen research [by waiting],"" he said. ""We couldn't put that in jeopardy.""

Stanziale said he was satisfied there wouldn't be a higher offer for the assets because they had been ""well shopped"" before and during bankruptcy.

Court papers show the company has made the necessary payments to maintain the clinical programs and research through December.

In a Feb. 12 motion, Stanziale said that in his business judgment the offer from RegenMedTX, which would relieve the estate of the secured claims, was superior to any bid from a third-party buyer.<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

""As a result, the Chapter 7 trustee believes that the buyer's offer for the assets is the highest or otherwise best offer that can be obtained under the circumstances,"" he said in the document.

Tengion's first clinical program was its Neo-Kidney Augment, intended to prevent or delay dialysis and transplantation by boosting renal function in patients that have advanced chronic kidney disease, according to its website. The debtor had received regulatory approval to begin clinical trials on the product.

Additionally, the company's second clinical program, Neo-Urinary Conduit, was in clinical trials. The product is an implant made from a patient's own cells and is ""intended to catalyze regeneration of native-like urinary tissue, thereby eliminating the need to use bowel tissue in the current standard of care surgery,"" the company said on its website.

Faced with a funding shortage, Tengion submitted a Chapter 7 petition on Dec. 29, just after the company warned of a potential filing.

The company's board of directors on Dec. 1 voted to terminate all 29 employees, who served in research, development, financial and administrative roles, according to a Dec. 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The debtor said it would pay out $916,000 in severance payments in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Tengion opted to let go of the employees to preserve cash, as it faced high operating expenditures and debt repayments.

""Despite these cost-cutting measures, if financing is not obtained, the company will not be able to remain in business and will likely need to seek protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws,"" the company warned in the filing.<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

Tengion announced on Sept. 22 that it had retained Jefferies LLC as financial adviser to assist it with ""reviewing and structuring potential strategic transactions.""

On March 26, auditor Ernst & Young LLP had issued a going concern warning for the company due to its recurring losses from operations and cash flow deficit.

In a Nov. 14 statement, Tengion said that it had experienced an adjusted net loss of $6.6 million for the three months ended Sept. 30.

The company blamed the loss on a rise in research and development expenses and administrative costs. The company also said legal costs related to the preparation of a market assessment of its kidney program also constrained cash flow.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Tengion reported a $19.3 million adjusted net loss on no revenue.

In its latest quarterly report, the company listed $9.62 million in assets and $93 million in liabilities as of Sept. 30. (In its petition, Tengion reported $1 million to $10 million in assets and $10 million to $50 million in liabilities.)

Tengion on July 1, 2013, raised $33.6 million in a private placement to fund Phase 1 clinical trials of its kidney program.

The company's shares, which trade on the OTC Pink tier of OTC Markets, closed down 25% at 0.15 cents Monday.

(CELG) will assign $20.56 million in claims to the buyer in exchange for 25% of the aggregate membership interests in the buyer, a clinical-stage company developing regenerative products.

The buyer will acquire all the debtor's intellectual property and biological samples related to its trials housed at its Winston-Salem, N.C., headquarters. (Three employees have been regularly monitoring the headquarters, including responding to any alarms at the property.)

No other offers for the assets were submitted by the Friday sale hearing, according to Jeffrey Testa of McCarter & English LLP, counsel to Chapter 7 trustee Charles A. Stanziale Jr.

""We think it's a great result whenever a trustee can both save a business and be in a position to make a distribution to unsecured creditors, so we believe it's a win-win,"" Testa said. He added that 5% of the net sale proceeds will be set aside to fund a recovery to unsecured creditors.

Stanziale said the buyer intended to put up the money to continue the approval process for Tengion's regenerative medicine.

He said that process could cost ""in the tens of millions of dollars"" and estimated it could take up to three years. Keeping the patents alone costs $100,000 per month, Stanziale said.

Stanziale, who acknowledged the sale would not ""in my view come close to paying creditors,"" added: ""Is it a plus to have the research and [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval [process] go forward in what may be a breakthrough health remedy? That's a different story, and that's a good thing.""<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

He continued, ""So all of the time and the effort and the money that has been spent for research and approval will not go out the window.""

Stanziale said the buyer originally did not offer to include a credit bid component and only offered $600,000 cash, but he and his team ""talked them up significantly.""

The deal was scheduled to close Monday.

""It had to be done quickly because the research that was in cold storage needed to be attended to, and we couldn't take the risk of losing the currency on the patents and losing the frozen research [by waiting],"" he said. ""We couldn't put that in jeopardy.""

Stanziale said he was satisfied there wouldn't be a higher offer for the assets because they had been ""well shopped"" before and during bankruptcy.

Court papers show the company has made the necessary payments to maintain the clinical programs and research through December.

In a Feb. 12 motion, Stanziale said that in his business judgment the offer from RegenMedTX, which would relieve the estate of the secured claims, was superior to any bid from a third-party buyer.<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

""As a result, the Chapter 7 trustee believes that the buyer's offer for the assets is the highest or otherwise best offer that can be obtained under the circumstances,"" he said in the document.

Tengion's first clinical program was its Neo-Kidney Augment, intended to prevent or delay dialysis and transplantation by boosting renal function in patients that have advanced chronic kidney disease, according to its website. The debtor had received regulatory approval to begin clinical trials on the product.

Additionally, the company's second clinical program, Neo-Urinary Conduit, was in clinical trials. The product is an implant made from a patient's own cells and is ""intended to catalyze regeneration of native-like urinary tissue, thereby eliminating the need to use bowel tissue in the current standard of care surgery,"" the company said on its website.

""Despite these cost-cutting measures, if financing is not obtained, the company will not be able to remain in business and will likely need to seek protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws,"" the company warned in the filing.<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

Tengion announced on Sept. 22 that it had retained Jefferies LLC as financial adviser to assist it with ""reviewing and structuring potential strategic transactions.""

On March 26, auditor Ernst & Young LLP had issued a going concern warning for the company due to its recurring losses from operations and cash flow deficit.

In a Nov. 14 statement, Tengion said that it had experienced an adjusted net loss of $6.6 million for the three months ended Sept. 30.

The company blamed the loss on a rise in research and development expenses and administrative costs. The company also said legal costs related to the preparation of a market assessment of its kidney program also constrained cash flow.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Tengion reported a $19.3 million adjusted net loss on no revenue.

In its latest quarterly report, the company listed $9.62 million in assets and $93 million in liabilities as of Sept. 30. (In its petition, Tengion reported $1 million to $10 million in assets and $10 million to $50 million in liabilities.)

Tengion on July 1, 2013, raised $33.6 million in a private placement to fund Phase 1 clinical trials of its kidney program.

The company's shares, which trade on the OTC Pink tier of OTC Markets, closed down 25% at 0.15 cents Monday.

Under the deal, secured creditors Deerfield Special Situations Fund LP, RA Capital Healthcare Funds LP and Celgene Corp. (CELG) will assign $20.56 million in claims to the buyer in exchange for 25% of the aggregate membership interests in the buyer, a clinical-stage company developing regenerative products.

The buyer will acquire all the debtor's intellectual property and biological samples related to its trials housed at its Winston-Salem, N.C., headquarters. (Three employees have been regularly monitoring the headquarters, including responding to any alarms at the property.)

No other offers for the assets were submitted by the Friday sale hearing, according to Jeffrey Testa of McCarter & English LLP, counsel to Chapter 7 trustee Charles A. Stanziale Jr.

""We think it's a great result whenever a trustee can both save a business and be in a position to make a distribution to unsecured creditors, so we believe it's a win-win,"" Testa said. He added that 5% of the net sale proceeds will be set aside to fund a recovery to unsecured creditors.

Stanziale said the buyer intended to put up the money to continue the approval process for Tengion's regenerative medicine.

He said that process could cost ""in the tens of millions of dollars"" and estimated it could take up to three years. Keeping the patents alone costs $100,000 per month, Stanziale said.

Stanziale, who acknowledged the sale would not ""in my view come close to paying creditors,"" added: ""Is it a plus to have the research and [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval [process] go forward in what may be a breakthrough health remedy? That's a different story, and that's a good thing.""<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

He continued, ""So all of the time and the effort and the money that has been spent for research and approval will not go out the window.""

Stanziale said the buyer originally did not offer to include a credit bid component and only offered $600,000 cash, but he and his team ""talked them up significantly.""

The deal was scheduled to close Monday.

""It had to be done quickly because the research that was in cold storage needed to be attended to, and we couldn't take the risk of losing the currency on the patents and losing the frozen research [by waiting],"" he said. ""We couldn't put that in jeopardy.""

Stanziale said he was satisfied there wouldn't be a higher offer for the assets because they had been ""well shopped"" before and during bankruptcy.

Court papers show the company has made the necessary payments to maintain the clinical programs and research through December.

In a Feb. 12 motion, Stanziale said that in his business judgment the offer from RegenMedTX, which would relieve the estate of the secured claims, was superior to any bid from a third-party buyer.<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

""As a result, the Chapter 7 trustee believes that the buyer's offer for the assets is the highest or otherwise best offer that can be obtained under the circumstances,"" he said in the document.

Tengion's first clinical program was its Neo-Kidney Augment, intended to prevent or delay dialysis and transplantation by boosting renal function in patients that have advanced chronic kidney disease, according to its website. The debtor had received regulatory approval to begin clinical trials on the product.

Additionally, the company's second clinical program, Neo-Urinary Conduit, was in clinical trials. The product is an implant made from a patient's own cells and is ""intended to catalyze regeneration of native-like urinary tissue, thereby eliminating the need to use bowel tissue in the current standard of care surgery,"" the company said on its website.

Faced with a funding shortage, Tengion submitted a Chapter 7 petition on Dec. 29, just after the company warned of a potential filing.

The company's board of directors on Dec. 1 voted to terminate all 29 employees, who served in research, development, financial and administrative roles, according to a Dec. 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The debtor said it would pay out $916,000 in severance payments in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Tengion opted to let go of the employees to preserve cash, as it faced high operating expenditures and debt repayments.

While doctors who treat young cancer patients hailed the approval, others expressed concern that prescribing OxyContin to children could put them at risk for addiction.

OxyContin, an extended-release version of the painkiller oxycodone, has gained notoriety in recent years because of its frequent abuse. People addicted to painkillers crush the pills so that they can be snorted or injected, producing a powerful high.

In 2010, Purdue Pharma reformulated OxyContin to make it more difficult to abuse.

The FDA notes that children generally have many fewer options for pain relief than adults. Because of that problem, the FDA asked Purdue to perform studies to see if the drug could be used safely in children, ages 11 to 16, with pain caused by cancer, trauma or major surgery, said Sharon Hertz, a physician with the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in an interview on the agency's website.

The FDA approved OxyContin for children this age who need ""daily, round-the-clock, long-term"" pain relief for which there is no alternative, Hertz said.

""Children are not treated with opioids very often and usually it's only for a limited period of time with close supervision by health care professionals,"" Hertz said. ""Fewer daily doses may free patients for physical therapy appointments, allow them to go home from the hospital sooner and may help them to sleep through the night without waking up.""

Children at the end of life aren't at risk of addiction.

Having additional long-acting painkillers ""is going to be tremendously helpful for treating children with cancer pain or pain at the end of life,"" said Justin Baker, pediatric oncologist and hospice and palliative medicine doctor at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

But prescribing OxyContin to youngsters with short-term medical needs could put them at risk for developing an addiction that haunts them long after they leave the hospital, said Andrew Kolodny, director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. Teens are at higher risk of addiction than adults because the brain doesn't mature until about age 25.

PAOLI, Pa., Jan. 5, 2015

PAOLI, Pa., Jan. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Dune Medical Devices announced FDA approval of an updated version of its flagship product, MarginProbe, a medical device that enables real-time detection of cancer at the surface of excised tissue specimens during breast-conserving cancer surgery.

Surgeon feedback, innovative design ideas, and superior miniaturization engineering were the driving forces behind the development of MarginProbe 1.2. This new version, which utilizes the same trusted, FDA-approved, diagnostic technology as version 1.1, is focused on proving superior functionality, portability, and overall ease of use.

""Our goal in offering this update is to provide surgeons with the most effective, easy-to-use product when they walk into a lumpectomy case,"" said Dan Hashimshony, CEO of Dune Medical Devices. ""Once the MarginProbe demonstrated national success across all territories, we began enhancing the usability for surgeons while offering simpler handling. Despite the fact that we offer the only product dedicated to the pressing need for intraoperative margin assessment in breast cancer surgery, we always knew it's critical we constantly listen to our loyal and growing customer base and do our best to offer them further innovation.""

Feature enhancements for MarginProbe 1.2 include: 


   -- Reduced Size & Weight: A major highlight of MarginProbe 1.2 is the 
      reduced size. The new unit is in tabletop form (29 x 43 x 38 cm in size) 
      and weighs 35 lbs. making it 75% lighter and much easier to handle in 
      today's busy operating rooms. 
 
   -- Brighter Screen: The screen's brightness has been enhanced to provide 
      surgeons a clearer screen image. 
 
   -- Wider Viewing angle: With MarginProbe 1.2, surgeons will have the ability 
      to clearly view the screen from anywhere in the operating room without 
      encountering a glare, pixilation, or a blind spot. 
 
   -- Improved on-screen notices: Ensuring key alerts are easier to notice in 
      the OR ambiance. 
 
   -- Startup Time Reduced 50%: The startup time for MarginProbe 1.2 is reduced 
      from approximately three minutes to 90 seconds, making MarginProbe's 
      services even more instantaneous. 
 
   -- Improved service time: Due to its new reduced size, technicians are able 
      to provide faster service, reducing down time in case service is needed. 

Additional information about MarginProbe 1.2 can be found at http://www.marginprobe.com/marginprobe-1-2/ . MarginProbe 1.1 is, and will remain, fully supported by Dune Medical Devices.

The ISM-MY report says current revenues and employment in New York City gained last month, while energy costs are seen as a positive for business conditions. But the cost of benefits remains the No. 1 net impediment. (kathleen.madigan@wsj.com)

9:47 EST - A deal announced Monday with Kite Pharma (KITE) will deepen Amgen's (AMGN) work in the hot field of cancer immunotherapies. Amgen executives have viewed immunotherapies as one of the most significant new developments in drug R&D. In December, the FDA approved Amgen's Blincyto cancer immunotherapy; Amgen also has another such drug, TVec, up for approval. Still, Amgen and its rivals are playing catch up with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which pioneered the field and has two approved drugs. Under the terms, Amgen will pay Kite $60M upfront, while Amgen would get single-digit royalties on sales of any approved drugs. AMGN falls 1.8% to $157.09.(jonathan.rockoff@wsj.com; @jonathanrockoff)

9:45 EST - Although the dollar hasn't come close to hitting trade-weighted and inflation-adjusted highs seen in 2002 and 1985, US exports are still more vulnerable than they've been in previous decades. The share of sales of US goods and services overseas as a percentage of GDP has steadily grown from just over 4% in 1980 to 7.6% in 2002 to nearly 15% last year. That's why Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, says many firms will report the dollar's gains eating into earnings. ""You're going to see a dollar effect on those numbers just simply by virtue of so many manufacturers having a presence overseas now."" (ian.talley@wsj.com)

9:42 EST - Petrobras (PBR PETR4.BR) down more than 7% in New York and 5% in Sao Paulo as the price of oil falls below $55, further denting the Brazilian oil company's already-battered shares. PBR fell 46% in 2014 as global oil prices fell and an alleged multi-billion corruption scheme centering around Petrobras contracts unfolded. With oil prices staying low, and new revelations about the corruption scandal continuing to emerge, the company's troubles look to be picking up in the new year right where they left off. (william.connors@wsj.com; @wconnors)

9:40 EST - Ford (F) starts to the downside in the wake of its December US sales data, which includes some color on how the overhauled F-150 is doing. Sales for the entire line of F-series pickups eased 0.3% last month, putting 2014's drop at 1.3% as the auto maker moved to heavily increase the amount of lighter-weight aluminum in the 150. The changeover curtailed pickup output and left some buyers on the sidelines as they awaited the new model. The new F-150 is the fastest-moving vehicle in F showrooms, averaging 5 days on lots last month. But that's not a surprise considering the pre-orders. Let's see how the inventory picture looks by spring. F falls 2.5% premarket to $14.98 while GM eases 0.5% as its US sales jumped 19% while F rose 1.2%. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

9:30 EST - Up nearly 30% the last 1/3 of 2014, Sonic (SONC) shares are unlikely to see a bump from the anticipated F1Q beat-and-raise Susquehanna expects the restaurant chain to post after the bell tomorrow. That as SONC's P-E multiple ""is just shy of its 10-year peak"" and 27% above its 3-year average, notes the investment bank, which does boost its price target $4 to $27 to catch up with the stock's end-of-year jump. Susquehanna also notes shorts have been washed out of SONC as short interest as of mid-December was down 1/4 from 2 months earlier, limiting the potential of a post-1Q squeeze. Shares closed Friday at $27.55. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

9:23 EST - It's no secret monetary policy is a big wild card for the 2015 outlook. Data from economist Paul Kasriel show October's end of the Fed's bond-purchase program may already be slowing credit growth. Growth in combined credit from US banks and bank reserves held at the Fed slowed to around 5.5% annualized in November from 9.7% in July, according to figures calculated by Kasriel, below the 7.4% average annual growth rate which prevailed from 1978-2006. ""This is not the stuff of recessions,"" says Kasriel. ""But it would be a mistake to extrapolate the strength we've seen in recent months into 2015."" (nick.timiraos@wsj.com; @NickTimiraos)

9:15 EST - BlackRock (BLK) says it captured $102.8B of the record $330.7B of net inflows that ETFs had last year. US and European inflows into iShares led the way, the asset manager notes, as Asian and Latin American clients in particular sought exposure to asset classes outside their respective regions. ""We're seeing ETFs truly come of age as more investors around the world recognize and embrace the versatility of these vehicles,"" says iShares chief Mark Wiedman. The business' assets under management topped $1T as of year's end. (katy.burne@wsj.com; @katyburne)

The deal will help NDAQ grow its index business, which has been a focus for the company recently. ""If [Nasdaq] is going to do an acquisition, this is the type we would like to see,"" adds Evercore. NDAQ is inactive premarket. (bradley.hope@wsj.com)

The high rating, they write, indicates an ""extreme positive reading,"" a strong contrarian signal for future returns. The strategists are among the least bullish on the street, calling for the S&P 500 to end the year at 2100, with a return of 4% including dividends. (dan.strumpf@wsj.com)

Activity cooled into year-end amid oil's price slump and resultant market-wide slowness of drilling. The investment bank says it'll ""ride out this industry downturn"" without dumping PTEN as shares are trading at only about 60% of the replacement cost of assets. The stock is down 1.8% premarket at $16.35 as oil falls further this morning. PTEN tumbled 49% in 4Q to reach 2 1/2-year lows. (dan.molinski@wsj.com; @dmwsj)

The new F-150 is the fastest-moving vehicle in F showrooms, averaging 5 days on lots last month. But that's not a surprise considering the pre-orders. Let's see how the inventory picture looks by spring. F falls 2.5% premarket to $14.98 while GM eases 0.5% as its US sales jumped 19% while F rose 1.2%. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

9:30 EST - Up nearly 30% the last 1/3 of 2014, Sonic (SONC) shares are unlikely to see a bump from the anticipated F1Q beat-and-raise Susquehanna expects the restaurant chain to post after the bell tomorrow. That as SONC's P-E multiple ""is just shy of its 10-year peak"" and 27% above its 3-year average, notes the investment bank, which does boost its price target $4 to $27 to catch up with the stock's end-of-year jump. Susquehanna also notes shorts have been washed out of SONC as short interest as of mid-December was down 1/4 from 2 months earlier, limiting the potential of a post-1Q squeeze. Shares closed Friday at $27.55. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

9:23 EST - It's no secret monetary policy is a big wild card for the 2015 outlook. Data from economist Paul Kasriel show October's end of the Fed's bond-purchase program may already be slowing credit growth. Growth in combined credit from US banks and bank reserves held at the Fed slowed to around 5.5% annualized in November from 9.7% in July, according to figures calculated by Kasriel, below the 7.4% average annual growth rate which prevailed from 1978-2006. ""This is not the stuff of recessions,"" says Kasriel. ""But it would be a mistake to extrapolate the strength we've seen in recent months into 2015."" (nick.timiraos@wsj.com; @NickTimiraos)

9:15 EST - BlackRock (BLK) says it captured $102.8B of the record $330.7B of net inflows that ETFs had last year.

Activity cooled into year-end amid oil's price slump and resultant market-wide slowness of drilling. The investment bank says it'll ""ride out this industry downturn"" without dumping PTEN as shares are trading at only about 60% of the replacement cost of assets.

9:47 EST - A deal announced Monday with Kite Pharma (KITE) will deepen Amgen's (AMGN) work in the hot field of cancer immunotherapies. Amgen executives have viewed immunotherapies as one of the most significant new developments in drug R&D. In December, the FDA approved Amgen's Blincyto cancer immunotherapy; Amgen also has another such drug, TVec, up for approval. Still, Amgen and its rivals are playing catch up with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which pioneered the field and has two approved drugs. Under the terms, Amgen will pay Kite $60M upfront, while Amgen would get single-digit royalties on sales of any approved drugs.

PR Newswire

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 8, 2015

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMMY), a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary compounded drug therapies, today announced its plans to introduce proprietary triamcinolone acetonide and moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Tri-Moxi) and prednisolone acetate and moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Pred-Moxi) combination eye drop formulations for patients following laser refractive surgery, including LASIK and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) surgery, cataract and other ocular surgeries.

The current treatment regimens following LASIK, cataract and other ocular surgeries include two or more daily self-administered topical eye drops for up to 4 weeks. It is well documented that current eye drop regimens can be confusing to patients, creating non-compliance issues and incorrect dosing.(1) For some high volume ocular surgeries, like PRK and LASIK, the company estimates that its combination Tri-Moxi and Pred-Moxi topical eye drop formulations can require up to 50% fewer drops to be administered by patients and may cost up to 75% less than current post-surgery drops regimens. Importantly, Imprimis' topical compounded drops may be eligible for reimbursement to patients covered by both public and private insurance plans. A prospective evaluation of de-identified quality assurance data of the Tri-Moxi and Pred-Moxi topical formulations for patients following LASIK surgery enrolled in the fall of 2014 at the Cleveland Eye Clinic. Imprimis expects the results of this research to be announced by the end of January 2015.

Imprimis' ophthalmic compound formulations have been optimized for the isotonicity and pH most compatible with the eye. Imprimis' patent-pending drug formulations allow for increased solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients, creating small, uniform particle sizes which enable functionality such as an injectable or use as a topical eye drop.

""We are pleased to make our Tri-Moxi and Pred-Moxi formulations available soon -- as an eye drop. This is a new application of our proprietary compound drug formulations, which allows for the combination of active pharmaceutical ingredients that do not normally combine well for administration. To date, we have made this technology available in single-use injectable ophthalmic formulations, which numerous ophthalmologists have reported on at major clinical meetings. While 95% of leading ophthalmologists surveyed would prefer Dropless Therapy(2) , many in the U.S. and abroad continue to prescribe eye drops for their patients following cataract surgery and other ocular procedures. The current single-API steroid and antibiotic eye drop choices for physicians and patients create compliance and cost issues for each of the parties involved. As a result, and in an effort to build a bridge to a 'Dropless' future for procedures like cataract surgery and to address the need for LessDrops(TM) in procedures like LASIK, we are seizing upon the opportunity to dramatically reduce the number of eye drop applications and lower costs by using our compounded formulations,"" stated Imprimis CEO Mark L. Baum.

Baum concluded, ""Imprimis believes in and is committed to quality, accessible innovation and solving unmet needs in the markets it serves. In 2015 and beyond, we look forward to continuing to introduce new applications of our proprietary formulations and technologies, particularly in ophthalmology, for injectable and topical applications.""

All Imprimis formulations may be prescribed pursuant to a physician prescription for an individually identified patient consistent with federal and state laws governing compounded drug formulations.

ABOUT LASIK

Over half of Americans require some form of vision correction and it is estimated that 43 million of these are candidates for refractive surgery. Nearly 96% of refractive procedures performed today are LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis), an outpatient surgical procedure used to treat nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology LASIK was first approved for use by the FDA in 1999 and it has quickly become one of today's most popular elective procedures with an estimated 700,000 procedures being performed annually in the U.S.

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 8, 2015

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMMY), a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary compounded drug therapies, today announced its plans to introduce proprietary triamcinolone acetonide and moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Tri-Moxi) and prednisolone acetate and moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Pred-Moxi) combination eye drop formulations for patients following laser refractive surgery, including LASIK and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) surgery, cataract and other ocular surgeries.

The current treatment regimens following LASIK, cataract and other ocular surgeries include two or more daily self-administered topical eye drops for up to 4 weeks. It is well documented that current eye drop regimens can be confusing to patients, creating non-compliance issues and incorrect dosing.(1) For some high volume ocular surgeries, like PRK and LASIK, the company estimates that its combination Tri-Moxi and Pred-Moxi topical eye drop formulations can require up to 50% fewer drops to be administered by patients and may cost up to 75% less than current post-surgery drops regimens. Importantly, Imprimis' topical compounded drops may be eligible for reimbursement to patients covered by both public and private insurance plans. A prospective evaluation of de-identified quality assurance data of the Tri-Moxi and Pred-Moxi topical formulations for patients following LASIK surgery enrolled in the fall of 2014 at the Cleveland Eye Clinic. Imprimis expects the results of this research to be announced by the end of January 2015.

Imprimis' ophthalmic compound formulations have been optimized for the isotonicity and pH most compatible with the eye. Imprimis' patent-pending drug formulations allow for increased solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients, creating small, uniform particle sizes which enable functionality such as an injectable or use as a topical eye drop.

""We are pleased to make our Tri-Moxi and Pred-Moxi formulations available soon -- as an eye drop. This is a new application of our proprietary compound drug formulations, which allows for the combination of active pharmaceutical ingredients that do not normally combine well for administration. To date, we have made this technology available in single-use injectable ophthalmic formulations, which numerous ophthalmologists have reported on at major clinical meetings. While 95% of leading ophthalmologists surveyed would prefer Dropless Therapy(2) , many in the U.S. and abroad continue to prescribe eye drops for their patients following cataract surgery and other ocular procedures. The current single-API steroid and antibiotic eye drop choices for physicians and patients create compliance and cost issues for each of the parties involved. As a result, and in an effort to build a bridge to a 'Dropless' future for procedures like cataract surgery and to address the need for LessDrops(TM) in procedures like LASIK, we are seizing upon the opportunity to dramatically reduce the number of eye drop applications and lower costs by using our compounded formulations,"" stated Imprimis CEO Mark L. Baum.

Baum concluded, ""Imprimis believes in and is committed to quality, accessible innovation and solving unmet needs in the markets it serves. In 2015 and beyond, we look forward to continuing to introduce new applications of our proprietary formulations and technologies, particularly in ophthalmology, for injectable and topical applications.""

All Imprimis formulations may be prescribed pursuant to a physician prescription for an individually identified patient consistent with federal and state laws governing compounded drug formulations.

ABOUT LASIK

Over half of Americans require some form of vision correction and it is estimated that 43 million of these are candidates for refractive surgery. Nearly 96% of refractive procedures performed today are LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis), an outpatient surgical procedure used to treat nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology LASIK was first approved for use by the FDA in 1999 and it has quickly become one of today's most popular elective procedures with an estimated 700,000 procedures being performed annually in the U.S.

(""AS&E"") (Nasdaq:ASEI), a leading worldwide supplier of innovative X-ray detection solutions, today announced the United Kingdom (UK) debut of MINI Z(TM), the world's first handheld Z Backscatter(R) imaging scanner for fast, portable, real-time detection of hidden drugs, explosives, and other organic threats and contraband behind non-metallic surfaces. The MINI Z system enables law enforcement, public safety and other security professionals to determine ""on the go"" if drugs, explosives or other threats are present in unattended bags, packages, and difficult-to-reach locations such as car interiors and aircraft compartments.

Since its launch in June 2014, the MINI Z system has been named the ""Best of What's New"" by Popular Science magazine and received the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) Accolades Award for Security Innovation. Recent customer demonstrations of the MINI Z system for U.S. public safety agencies have led to actual drug seizures, including a large quantity of well-concealed marijuana valued at more than $150,000 USD.

""As AS&E continues to make inroads into the international public safety market, we are very pleased to work together with our new channel partner, Scanna, to introduce the MINI Z to security and police agencies in the UK,"" said Chuck Dougherty, AS&E's President and CEO. ""The MINI Z, like our ZBV(R) mobile inspection system, is a highly effective, easy-to-use, detection solution that is ideal for detecting security threats wherever and whenever they occur. Using the MINI Z, we are confident that customers in the UK -- and elsewhere in the world -- will achieve the same, immediate results that U.S. public safety agencies have experienced using the system.""

AS&E and Scanna will conduct demos at booth #C96 during the Security & Policing Event 2015, held at the FIVE exhibition hall in Farnborough, Hampshire, UK from March 10--12, 2015. Security & Policing is the UK's premier event for police, law enforcement, and security professionals tasked with security, civil protection, and National Resilience. Scanna is a leading supplier of portable X-ray and postal security equipment and AS&E's authorized supplier of MINI Z systems in the UK.

The MINI Z system is ideal for security and public safety officials for many different applications, including: 


   -- Border and Security Checkpoints: Inspecting vehicle bumpers, tires, and 
      interiors for drugs, explosives, currency and other concealed threats and 
      contraband. 
 
   -- Drug Interdiction: Screening interiors of vehicles and facilities for 
      concealed drugs and currency. 
 
   -- Public Safety: Quick screening of unattended and suspicious bags and 
      packages in public spaces. 
 
   -- Event Security:  Screening small personal items to ensure public safety. 
 
   -- VIP Security: Security sweeps of meeting rooms and furniture to ensure 
      personnel safety. 
 
   -- Maritime Security: Screening the hulls and bulkheads of suspected drug 
      running boats for contraband or narcotics. 
 
   -- General Aviation Security: Inspecting the seats, compartments, and panels 
      of planes for hidden contraband. 

MINI Z -- the World's First Handheld Z Backscatter(R) Imaging System: 


   -- Scans in places other systems can't reach: The MINI Z system is a compact, 
      single-sided imager that can be used to scan objects in hard-to-reach 
      areas, such as unattended bags, backpacks, or packages in a subway or bus 
      station. 
 
   -- Unsurpassed detection of organic threats: The MINI Z handheld system uses 
      AS&E's signature Z Backscatter technology, an advanced X-ray imaging 
      technology that produces a real-time image of the scan target, 
      highlighting organic materials that transmission X-ray systems can miss, 
      such as explosives, currency, and drugs. Unlike density meters, trace 
      detectors, or portable transmission X-ray systems, the MINI Z system 
      produces an easy-to-interpret image to quickly detect organic threats and 
      contraband behind non-metallic surfaces. 
 
   -- An easy to use, all-in-one imaging system: The MINI Z system is 
      self-contained and does not require set-up, enabling immediate operation. 
      The operator controls the scanning function using a simple, intuitive GUI 
      on the system's dedicated tablet, upon which an image of the scanned 
      target appears in real-time. 
 
   -- Safe, secure, and dependable operation: The MINI Z system is safe for 
      operators, bystanders, and the environment. The system's X-ray dose 
      conforms to the appropriate ANSI, ICRP, NCRP, and EURATOM radiation 
      safety standards. Although the MINI Z is a low-energy and low-dose Z 
      Backscatter system, it is not designed to scan people. The MINI Z system 
      must be used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, as well 
      as applicable laws and regulations.

(""AS&E"") (Nasdaq:ASEI), a leading worldwide supplier of innovative X-ray detection solutions, today announced the United Kingdom (UK) debut of MINI Z(TM), the world's first handheld Z Backscatter(R) imaging scanner for fast, portable, real-time detection of hidden drugs, explosives, and other organic threats and contraband behind non-metallic surfaces. The MINI Z system enables law enforcement, public safety and other security professionals to determine ""on the go"" if drugs, explosives or other threats are present in unattended bags, packages, and difficult-to-reach locations such as car interiors and aircraft compartments.

Since its launch in June 2014, the MINI Z system has been named the ""Best of What's New"" by Popular Science magazine and received the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) Accolades Award for Security Innovation. Recent customer demonstrations of the MINI Z system for U.S. public safety agencies have led to actual drug seizures, including a large quantity of well-concealed marijuana valued at more than $150,000 USD.

""As AS&E continues to make inroads into the international public safety market, we are very pleased to work together with our new channel partner, Scanna, to introduce the MINI Z to security and police agencies in the UK,"" said Chuck Dougherty, AS&E's President and CEO. ""The MINI Z, like our ZBV(R) mobile inspection system, is a highly effective, easy-to-use, detection solution that is ideal for detecting security threats wherever and whenever they occur. Using the MINI Z, we are confident that customers in the UK -- and elsewhere in the world -- will achieve the same, immediate results that U.S. public safety agencies have experienced using the system.""

AS&E and Scanna will conduct demos at booth #C96 during the Security & Policing Event 2015, held at the FIVE exhibition hall in Farnborough, Hampshire, UK from March 10--12, 2015. Security & Policing is the UK's premier event for police, law enforcement, and security professionals tasked with security, civil protection, and National Resilience. Scanna is a leading supplier of portable X-ray and postal security equipment and AS&E's authorized supplier of MINI Z systems in the UK.

The MINI Z system is ideal for security and public safety officials for many different applications, including: 


   -- Border and Security Checkpoints: Inspecting vehicle bumpers, tires, and 
      interiors for drugs, explosives, currency and other concealed threats and 
      contraband. 
 
   -- Drug Interdiction: Screening interiors of vehicles and facilities for 
      concealed drugs and currency. 
 
   -- Public Safety: Quick screening of unattended and suspicious bags and 
      packages in public spaces. 
 
   -- Event Security:  Screening small personal items to ensure public safety. 
 
   -- VIP Security: Security sweeps of meeting rooms and furniture to ensure 
      personnel safety. 
 
   -- Maritime Security: Screening the hulls and bulkheads of suspected drug 
      running boats for contraband or narcotics. 
 
   -- General Aviation Security: Inspecting the seats, compartments, and panels 
      of planes for hidden contraband. 

MINI Z -- the World's First Handheld Z Backscatter(R) Imaging System: 


   -- Scans in places other systems can't reach: The MINI Z system is a compact, 
      single-sided imager that can be used to scan objects in hard-to-reach 
      areas, such as unattended bags, backpacks, or packages in a subway or bus 
      station. 
 
   -- Unsurpassed detection of organic threats: The MINI Z handheld system uses 
      AS&E's signature Z Backscatter technology, an advanced X-ray imaging 
      technology that produces a real-time image of the scan target, 
      highlighting organic materials that transmission X-ray systems can miss, 
      such as explosives, currency, and drugs. Unlike density meters, trace 
      detectors, or portable transmission X-ray systems, the MINI Z system 
      produces an easy-to-interpret image to quickly detect organic threats and 
      contraband behind non-metallic surfaces. 
 
   -- An easy to use, all-in-one imaging system: The MINI Z system is 
      self-contained and does not require set-up, enabling immediate operation. 
      The operator controls the scanning function using a simple, intuitive GUI 
      on the system's dedicated tablet, upon which an image of the scanned 
      target appears in real-time. 
 
   -- Safe, secure, and dependable operation: The MINI Z system is safe for 
      operators, bystanders, and the environment. The system's X-ray dose 
      conforms to the appropriate ANSI, ICRP, NCRP, and EURATOM radiation 
      safety standards. Although the MINI Z is a low-energy and low-dose Z 
      Backscatter system, it is not designed to scan people. The MINI Z system 
      must be used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, as well 
      as applicable laws and regulations.

IMPLANET (Euronext: IMPL, FR0010458729, PEA-PME eligible), a medical technology company specializing in vertebral and knee-surgery implants, today announces its annual results for the financial year to December 31, 2014, as approved by the Board on March 18, 2015.

Ludovic Lastennet, CEO of Implanet, states: ""The sale of 4,260 JAZZ implants in 2014 represents an impressive achievement. We met our sales targets, notably thanks to the rapid structuring of our subsidiary in the United States. We generated growth in our Knee platform, while the impact of the discontinuation of our Hip activity should disappear in early 2015. We are highly optimistic for the future, notably because of strict structural cost management and the substantial success of our recent capital increase, which has given us the resources to accelerate JAZZ's expansion in spine surgery and make it a global benchmark in healthcare.""

2014: significant acceleration in global JAZZ sales

Excluding Hip activity, discontinued in early 2014, Implanet generated strong revenue growth of +28%. Including Hip activity, in 2014 the Company generated growth of +5% to EUR7,037 thousand. French sales totaled EUR3,985 thousand (57% of 2014 revenue), while Export sales totaled EUR3,052 thousand (43% of 2014 revenue). The U.S. subsidiary continued its progression with sales of EUR821 thousand (12% of 2014 revenue), equaling one million dollars in sales in its first full year.

This performance illustrates the excellent momentum gained in Spine, with 2.4X sales growth, to EUR1,930 thousand, compared with the previous year. In 2014, Implanet sold 4,260 JAZZ implants (vs. 1,829 in 2013), an increase of +133%.

Improvement in the gross margin, operating costs under control

The 2014 gross margin was 41.7%, up 4.2 percentage points (vs. 37.5% in 2013), reflecting the higher contribution of increased JAZZ sales in the product mix. In cash terms, the 2014 gross margin improved by +EUR428 thousand to EUR2,938 thousand (from EUR2,510 thousand in 2013).

Operating costs rose by +EUR570 thousand to EUR9,575 thousand (vs. EUR9,005 thousand in 2013). The most significant impacts were investment in the Implanet America subsidiary, spending of EUR1,295 thousand, a 2013 provision for the impairment of inventories (mainly for Hip activity) leading to a positive variation of +EUR1,253 thousand on the cost of operations in 2014, and the impact of the IFRS restatement of the fair value of warrants issued to staff for EUR552 thousand. The remaining structural costs were stable, illustrating the Company's control of its operating costs.

Once these elements are taken into account, Implanet recorded an operating loss of -EUR6,637 thousand (vs. -EUR6,495 thousand in 2013) and a net loss of -EUR6,872 thousand (vs. -EUR6,843 thousand in 2013) in 2014.

As of December 31, 2014, Implanet had cash and financial placements of EUR5.2 million (vs. EUR8.7 million at the end of June 2014), split between ""cash and cash equivalents"" (EUR2.1 million), ""other current financial assets"" (EUR2.8 million) and ""other non-current financial assets"" (EUR0.3 million). Following the capital increase completed in March 2015, cash and financial placements totaled EUR12.5 million at March 31.

As of December 31, 2014, Implanet had a workforce of 45, including 6 staff in the United States.

2014/2015 achievements and key events

IMPLANET (Euronext: IMPL, FR0010458729, PEA-PME eligible), a medical technology company specializing in vertebral and knee-surgery implants, today announces its annual results for the financial year to December 31, 2014, as approved by the Board on March 18, 2015.

Ludovic Lastennet, CEO of Implanet, states: ""The sale of 4,260 JAZZ implants in 2014 represents an impressive achievement. We met our sales targets, notably thanks to the rapid structuring of our subsidiary in the United States. We generated growth in our Knee platform, while the impact of the discontinuation of our Hip activity should disappear in early 2015. We are highly optimistic for the future, notably because of strict structural cost management and the substantial success of our recent capital increase, which has given us the resources to accelerate JAZZ's expansion in spine surgery and make it a global benchmark in healthcare.""

2014: significant acceleration in global JAZZ sales

Excluding Hip activity, discontinued in early 2014, Implanet generated strong revenue growth of +28%. Including Hip activity, in 2014 the Company generated growth of +5% to EUR7,037 thousand. French sales totaled EUR3,985 thousand (57% of 2014 revenue), while Export sales totaled EUR3,052 thousand (43% of 2014 revenue). The U.S. subsidiary continued its progression with sales of EUR821 thousand (12% of 2014 revenue), equaling one million dollars in sales in its first full year.

This performance illustrates the excellent momentum gained in Spine, with 2.4X sales growth, to EUR1,930 thousand, compared with the previous year. In 2014, Implanet sold 4,260 JAZZ implants (vs. 1,829 in 2013), an increase of +133%.

Improvement in the gross margin, operating costs under control

The 2014 gross margin was 41.7%, up 4.2 percentage points (vs. 37.5% in 2013), reflecting the higher contribution of increased JAZZ sales in the product mix. In cash terms, the 2014 gross margin improved by +EUR428 thousand to EUR2,938 thousand (from EUR2,510 thousand in 2013).

Operating costs rose by +EUR570 thousand to EUR9,575 thousand (vs. EUR9,005 thousand in 2013). The most significant impacts were investment in the Implanet America subsidiary, spending of EUR1,295 thousand, a 2013 provision for the impairment of inventories (mainly for Hip activity) leading to a positive variation of +EUR1,253 thousand on the cost of operations in 2014, and the impact of the IFRS restatement of the fair value of warrants issued to staff for EUR552 thousand. The remaining structural costs were stable, illustrating the Company's control of its operating costs.

Once these elements are taken into account, Implanet recorded an operating loss of -EUR6,637 thousand (vs. -EUR6,495 thousand in 2013) and a net loss of -EUR6,872 thousand (vs. -EUR6,843 thousand in 2013) in 2014.

As of December 31, 2014, Implanet had cash and financial placements of EUR5.2 million (vs. EUR8.7 million at the end of June 2014), split between ""cash and cash equivalents"" (EUR2.1 million), ""other current financial assets"" (EUR2.8 million) and ""other non-current financial assets"" (EUR0.3 million). Following the capital increase completed in March 2015, cash and financial placements totaled EUR12.5 million at March 31.

As of December 31, 2014, Implanet had a workforce of 45, including 6 staff in the United States.

There's more risk because there's more distraction--and people in new roles may not have institutional experience to fall back on. ""We have some very significant financial goals that have to be reached and if we don't manage the risk side well it will be a lot harder and less efficient,"" says Peter Rosiere, vice president of risk management for North America at Sodexo.

13:14 EDT - The US legal services sector shed 1,200 jobs in March, dipping slightly below employment levels at the start of the year, the Labor Department said as part of today's employment report. The total number of legal jobs now stands at 1.12M, a preliminary and seasonally adjusted figure around which the sector's employment has hovered the past year and that's still tens of thousands short of pre-recession levels. Counted in the space includes lawyers, paralegals, legal consultants, process servers, notaries and patent agents, among others. Legal's March decline came as overall US job growth was far below expectations and the least in more than a year. (jacob.gershman@wsj.com)

13:06 EDT - Morgan Stanley's own Fed timing measure, known as M1KE (number of months before the first rate hike), reflects expectations for a delay in tightening after this morning's weak jobs report. The measure is now at 8.5 months, versus about 6 months in mid-March, so it's suggesting the 1st rate hike won't come until December. Despite the delay, it compares to a M1KE measure of 45 months for the ECB. Morgan Stanley says a wide gap sets up well for US bonds, recommending investors buy 10-year Treasurys while selling 10-year German bunds and twice as many 10-year Japan bonds. US 10-years yield 1.84%, while German 10s yield 0.19% and Japanese 10s yield 0.35%. (cynthia.lin@wsj.com; @cynthialin_dj)

12:49 EDT - Friday's price rally in US Treasurys caps a winning weak for bond buyers. The 10-year Treasury yield ends at a two-month low of 1.84% today in a shortened holiday session, and for the week falls about 11 bps. The yield has tumbled from this year's peak of 2.24% on March 6 after a strong February jobs report. But sentiment has swung to a more downbeat view of the economy, and now many investors expect the Fed to stand pat on tightening until very late this year. (min.zeng@wsj.com; @minzengwsj)

12:41 EDT - As regulators angst over how to boost oil train safety, one railroad is taking unilateral actions. That's unusual since it will slow trains and pressure peers in an industry where major players nearly always act in concert. Earlier this year, BNSF Railway began charging extra for each older railcar shippers use for crude. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers sued saying that's improper. Last week, BNSF additionally said it would slow its oil trains to 35 MPH from 40 in certain populated areas and would increase inspections of tracks and cars. That will slow BNSF's entire system and undoubtedly make some other freight railroads squirm. (betsy.morris@wsj.com)

12:28 EDT - C&A Marketing has closed a $1.9M dollar deal to purchase SkyMall's trademark and online business, according to a C&A Marketing spokeswoman. The sale could mark a new beginning for SkyMall, which is best known for the quirky products it sold through its in-flight catalog. Chaim Pikarski, an owner and executive at New Jersey-based C&A Marketing, told The Wall Street Journal that he plans to turn around the failed business, capitalizing on its widely recognized brand. That process, he says, may include reinstating the now-defunct SkyMall catalog, beloved by many frequent fliers. C&A Marketing has a history of buying up bankrupt businesses with strong brands, including Polaroid and Ritz Camera stores. (tom.corrigan@wsj.com)

12:18 EDT - Venture capitalists are funding startups with technologies to help health-care providers adapt to shifts in medical reimbursement. Conventional, fee-for-service health care pays for every service piecemeal. Medicare and private insurers are testing bundled-payment strategies that instead pay a lump sum for a medical procedure. This encourages care providers to eliminate waste and to quickly catch problems that could increase the cost of treating a patient. VC-backed HealthLoop's cloud-based system helps doctors monitor patients who are recovering from surgery. This helps them catch infections and other complications before they become severe. HealthLoop just signed Cedars-Sinai Health System as a customer. Other care-coordination companies raising venture capital include Cureatr and Caremerge. (brian.gormley@wsj.com)

12:06 EDT - The popular night trading sessions run by the Shanghai Gold Exchange and Shanghai Futures Exchange are giving gold traders there a head start on counterparts in London and New York today. While markets in Europe and Asia are closed for Good Friday, Chinese traders are able to react to today's disappointing jobs report says RBC's George Gero. Mr. Gero said that gold nudged higher in the Far East following the U.S. employment data, ""but it didn't spike."" Still, gold's reaction is likely to be more pronounced on Sunday night, when electronic trading in U.S. stock and bond futures as well as commodities resumes. ""There will be more markets and more liquidity,"" Mr. Gero said. (tatyana.shumsky@wsj.com; @MissShumsky)

11:57 EDT - While a number of analysts have voiced concerns about railroad's 1Q cargo volumes coming in lower than expected, the sector has surprised in the past in such periods with higher operating-earnings gains than expected, notes Barclays. It finds in 16 cases since 2004, such profits rose more than 5% while volumes fell. ""Pricing and productivity are also important drivers of railroad earnings,"" notes Barclays, which expect the sector's pricing power to continue rising this year. Plus, railroads may report efficiency gains after spending money last year to improve service and capacity. (laura.stevens@wsj.com; @LauraStevensWSJ)

11:55 EDT - People with illnesses like cancer often battle depression and other mental-health problems. Quartet Health has raised $7M in venture capital to help patients get the medical and mental-health care they need. Patients often struggle to get mental health care because of a shortage of clinicians and a lack of financial incentives for primary-care and mental-health-care physicians to collaborate. Quartet's technology connects PCPs and mental-health clinicians to make collaboration easier. The startup, whose primary customers are health plans, is also working with partners on reimbursement structures that encourage collaboration. Others raising VC to improve access to mental-health care include software startup Pear Therapeutics. (brian.gormley@wsj.com)

11:52 EDT - Rail analyst Tony Hatch asks whether ""deals may be back?"" in a new report on the short-line railroad sector after attending the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association convention in Orlando, Florida. ""There was certainly a fair amount of money around"" he writes, from private equity and strategic investors, along with short lines' higher valuations and need for capital investment. He came away with a ""general sense"" that deal conversations were more serious than in prior years. (betsy.morris@wsj.com)

LEXINGTON, Massachusetts, United States and SYDNEY, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 30, 2015-- 

GI Dynamics, Inc. (ASX: GID) (GI Dynamics or the Company), a medical device company developing innovative treatments for type 2 diabetes and obesity, is pleased to provide its financial results for the quarter ended 31 March 2015 (Quarter). The Appendix 4C, which has been prepared in U.S. dollars under U.S. GAAP, is attached and the results disclosed in the Appendix 4C are unaudited.

The Company plans to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and with the Australian Securities Exchange on or before 15 May 2015. The Form 10-Q will provide financial statements for the Quarter, along with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Quarter.

ENDO Trial

At the recommendation of the FDA, the Company has discontinued placing any additional devices in its U.S. pivotal clinical trial of EndoBarrier Therapy (the ENDO Trial); although monitoring and data collection of the 325 currently enrolled subjects continues. The Company has already implemented several risk mitigation strategies in the ENDO Trial and is preparing to submit the information requested by the FDA for their review.

Financial Review

The Company's key financial results for the Quarter include the following: 


   -- Revenue decreased to US$0.6 million for the Quarter compared to US$0.9 
      million for the same period last year, a decrease of US$0.3 million. The 
      decrease in the Company's revenue in the Quarter compared to the same 
      period last year was a result of a decrease in sales across all markets. 
      Compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, revenue increased US$0.1 million 
      due to increased sales in Europe and the Middle East. 
   -- Cost of revenue for the Quarter and same period last year was US$0.9 
      million. The Quarter experienced decreased manufacturing efficiency due 
      to lower production volume compared to the same period last year. As a 
      result, gross loss increased by US$0.3 million for the Quarter. 
 
   -- Operating expenses decreased to US$9.6 million for the Quarter compared 
      to US$10.1 million for the same period last year, a decrease of US$0.5 
      million. 
 
          -- Research and development expenses were US$5.6 million for the 
             Quarter compared to US$5.3 million for the same period last year, 
             an increase of US$0.3 million. The increase in research and 
             development expenses for the Quarter was primarily a result of 
             increased expenses to support the ENDO Trial and increased

             expenses for the Quarter compared to the same period last year was 
             the result of lower spending on marketing related activities to 
             support the Company's commercialization effort as well as lower 
             personnel related costs, particularly share-based compensation.

   -- Other income (expense) for the Quarter was a US$0.5 million loss compared 
      to a gain of US$0.4 million for the same period last year, a decrease of 
      US$0.9 million. The decrease in the Quarter compared to the same period 
      last year was primarily associated with a US$0.5 million foreign exchange 
      loss due to the depreciation of the Australian dollar versus the U.S. 
      dollar during the Quarter as compared to a US$0.2 million foreign 
      exchange gain in the same period last year as a result of a stronger 
      Australian dollar. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2014 the Company 
      had a US$0.2 million gain on the remeasurement of the warrant liability 
      while in the Quarter it had a minimal loss on remeasurement. 
 
   -- As a result, the Company recorded a net loss of US$10.3 million for the 
      Quarter compared to US$9.7 million for the same period last year, an 
      increase of US$0.6 million. 
 
   -- The Company had cash and cash equivalents of US$40.0 million at 31 March 
      2015 compared to US$51.2 million at 31 December 2014, a decrease of 
      US$11.2 million.

ENDO Trial

At the recommendation of the FDA, the Company has discontinued placing any additional devices in its U.S. pivotal clinical trial of EndoBarrier Therapy (the ENDO Trial); although monitoring and data collection of the 325 currently enrolled subjects continues. The Company has already implemented several risk mitigation strategies in the ENDO Trial and is preparing to submit the information requested by the FDA for their review.

Financial Review

The Company's key financial results for the Quarter include the following: 


   -- Revenue decreased to US$0.6 million for the Quarter compared to US$0.9 
      million for the same period last year, a decrease of US$0.3 million. The 
      decrease in the Company's revenue in the Quarter compared to the same 
      period last year was a result of a decrease in sales across all markets. 
      Compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, revenue increased US$0.1 million 
      due to increased sales in Europe and the Middle East. 
   -- Cost of revenue for the Quarter and same period last year was US$0.9 
      million. The Quarter experienced decreased manufacturing efficiency due 
      to lower production volume compared to the same period last year. As a 
      result, gross loss increased by US$0.3 million for the Quarter. 
 
   -- Operating expenses decreased to US$9.6 million for the Quarter compared 
      to US$10.1 million for the same period last year, a decrease of US$0.5 
      million. 
 
          -- Research and development expenses were US$5.6 million for the 
             Quarter compared to US$5.3 million for the same period last year, 
             an increase of US$0.3 million. The increase in research and 
             development expenses for the Quarter was primarily a result of 
             increased expenses to support the ENDO Trial and increased 
             consulting expenses. These were partially offset by a decrease in 
             personnel related costs. 
 
          -- Sales and marketing expenses were US$1.7 million for the Quarter 
             compared to US$2.5 million for the same period last year, a 
             decrease of US$0.8 million. The decrease in sales and marketing 
             expenses for the Quarter compared to the same period last year was 
             the result of lower spending on marketing related activities to 
             support the Company's commercialization effort as well as lower 
             personnel related costs, particularly share-based compensation.

      US$0.9 million. The decrease in the Quarter compared to the same period

Becton now expects to report per-share earnings of $6.43 to $6.50, down from earlier guidance of $6.50 to $6.57. On a currency-adjusted basis, the company said, it hasn't changed its earnings forecast. Sales will decline 1.5% but grow 5% when foreign exchange effects are stripped out, Becton said. The affirmed adjusted revenue growth estimate translates to $8.9 billion.

Including CareFusion, Becton expects adjusted per-share profit of $7 to $7.10 this year on 4.5% organic revenue growth.

Analysts, according to Thomson Reuters, are projecting adjusted full-year earnings of $7.07 and revenue of $10.4 billion.

The New Jersey-based company closed the $12.2 billion acquisition in March. The deal was a move to provide a fuller range of supplies, and also the tools hospitals need to cope with health insurers, who are pressing them to curb spending and provide more cost-effective care. Becton sells things like catheters that nurses use to administer drugs, while CareFusion has been making the machines that pump the drugs into the catheters.

""We look forward to the future with confidence as we integrate the acquisition of CareFusion,"" Becton Chief Executive Vincent Forlenza said Thursday.

In the latest quarter, foreign exchange fluctuations shaved 10 cents per share off of the company's bottom line. In 2014, the company generated 60% of its sales abroad. International revenue during the latest period fell 4.7% to $1.2 billion. On a currency-adjusted basis, international sales rose 5.2%. The company noted softness in Japan due to the impact of the timing of government funding as well as softness in emerging markets, particularly in China and Brazil.

In all for the fiscal second quarter, Becton reported a profit of $216 million, or $1.08 a share, down from year-earlier earnings of $287 million, or $1.45 a share. Excluding items like costs associated with the CareFusion acquisition, per-share profit rose to 1.61 from $1.59.

Revenue decreased 1% to $2.1 billion.

Analysts, according to Thomson Reuters, expected $1.53 in earnings per share and $2 billion in sales.

In the company's medical division, which accounted for more than half of the Becton's overall revenue last year, sales slid 0.9% to $1.1 billion. A 6.2% drop in pharmaceutical systems sales weighed on the segment. On a currency-adjusted basis, medical segment revenue rose 5.4%.

Sales in Becton's life sciences business declined 1.1% to $945 million but rose 4.4% before currency effects. The company noted that the segment was negatively impacted by the timing of government funding in Japan. Within the unit, diagnostic and biosciences revenue rose 7.5% and 7.7%, respectively.

Shares in the company, up about 1% this year, were inactive in pre-market trading.

Instead, it's based on being smarter about using the longtime mainstay treatments for ovarian cancer: surgery and chemotherapy.

Using the strategy, which involves assigning a score on the severity of the cancer to guide treatment, doctors at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston have succeeded in removing all visible disease in 86% of treated women over the past two years. That's more than quadruple the 20% rate the doctors had achieved before starting the protocol.

The doctors haven't yet proved that the strategy will extend lives, but they're anticipating a dramatic impact. Other recent studies indicate that complete surgical removal of visible disease doubles the chances -- to more than 60% -- that a woman will survive at least five years after diagnosis.

The idea was ""to take information that's already known and implement it into practice so we could immediately have an impact on patient survival,"" says Alpa Nick, a gynecological cancer specialist at MD Anderson and a leader of the effort to implement the protocol.

Part of the challenge of treating ovarian cancer is that early symptoms often mimic other less serious problems. It is typically discovered late, after it has already spread beyond the ovaries. Making matters more problematic, as the cancer spreads, tumor cells form a coating over other organs and structures in the abdomen and it is difficult to determine the extent of the disease with imaging.

The initiative, part of what MD Anderson calls its Moon Shots project to significantly reduce mortality across a variety of tumors, reflects broader ongoing efforts to improve results from chemotherapy and other standard treatments.

Oncology is in the midst of headline-grabbing advances in genetically targeted drugs and immunotherapy treatments that are beginning to transform treatment of cancer. But so far, only a relatively small number of patients with only a few types of cancer have benefited. That means most cancer patients continue to be treated with chemotherapy and other standard regimens, such as radiation and surgery.

""They will likely continue to get chemotherapy at some point in their treatment course for a good, long while,"" says Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. ""So it's important to try to improve on"" the conventional treatments even as the latest remedies break new ground.

In pediatrics, for example, researchers have essentially cured a wide variety of childhood cancers, even though hardly any new drugs for children's cancer have been approved in the past half century.

In recent years, several large studies, many of them funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, have led to improved outcomes for patients with breast, prostate and other tumors. Researchers have shown, for instance, that giving smaller doses of chemo every two weeks instead of aggressive doses every three weeks is associated with better survival, Dr. Schilsky says. At last year's annual ASCO meeting, doctors reported that adding a chemotherapy to widely used hormone therapy significantly extended survival for prostate cancer patients.

More than 21,000 women in the U.S. are expected to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, according to the American Cancer Society. More than 14,000 women will die from the disease, making it the fifth-most lethal cancer for women.

For decades, the standard treatment has been surgery at the time of diagnosis, followed by chemotherapy. But some patients get chemo first, especially in cases where their disease is found in the liver or outside the abdomen. The idea is to reduce the amount of tumor in the body before surgeons operate to remove what remains.

Whether surgery first or chemo first yields the better surgical results isn't clear. A recent large, randomized study comparing the approaches found no difference in survival, but showed that those in each group where all visible cancer was removed fared best.

The goal has always been to remove as much visible cancer as possible. But only in the past few years has research shown the importance of getting all of it -- a goal doctors call an R-zero resection.

""Today there is more and more data that says unless you get to the R-zero resection, the marginal benefit of the surgery really tapers off,"" says Scott McMeekin, section chief of gynecologic oncology at the University of Oklahoma's Stephenson Cancer Center in Oklahoma City, which has adopted the new approach.

Still, an R-zero resection isn't considered a cure. Residual, microscopic levels of the disease that can't be seen or felt by the surgeon can eventually trigger a recurrence.

At MD Anderson, surgeons were getting an R-zero result in only about 20% of cases, generally in line with that achieved at other centers, researchers say. With the new strategy, ""we're really re-looking at the foundation for how we treated women"" with the disease, says Karen Lu, chief of gynecologic oncology at MD Anderson.

The protocol, which MD Anderson doctors call the Anderson algorithm, is based on a scoring system developed by Anna Fagotti and her colleagues at Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome. Using a laparoscope inserted through a small incision in the abdomen, the Italian researchers looked directly at the extent of a patient's disease and scored it on a scale of 0 to 14, with 0 the least severe and 14 the most. They showed that patients with a score of 8 or above had a better surgical result if they were given chemo first, while those below 8 did well with surgery first.

As MD Anderson has refined the strategy, two doctors must independently agree on the score. The center began implementing the protocol two years ago. The results so far: Among 105 patients, 73 scored below 8, 10 of whom opted for chemo first anyway. Of the remaining 63 patients, 54, or 86%, had complete removal of visible disease. Of those who scored 8 or higher, 23 underwent three cycles of chemo before surgery, of whom 19 (82%) achieved an R-zero result.

One participating patient was Theresa Duff of Katy, Texas. The 58-year-old retail sales manager at a Dillard's department store was diagnosed in March 2013 and treated at MD Anderson the following month. When told of the protocol, she says, ""I was all for it."" Though ""overwhelmed"" by the cancer diagnosis, she believed ""the team is only going to do what's good for me. I didn't hesitate.""

She scored below 8 and had surgery first, leading to an optimal result. ""I'm feeling great and there are no signs of the cancer coming back,"" she says.

The protocol has another advantage. During laparoscopy, doctors can obtain a tumor specimen that they can compare with a subsequent biopsy obtained at surgery. Moon Shot researchers hope a before-and-after molecular analysis of patients' tumors will reveal clues to new treatments that improve care for ovarian cancer beyond surgery and chemo.

Instead, it's based on being smarter about using the longtime mainstay treatments for ovarian cancer: surgery and chemotherapy.

Using the strategy, which involves assigning a score on the severity of the cancer to guide treatment, doctors at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston have succeeded in removing all visible disease in 86% of treated women over the past two years. That's more than quadruple the 20% rate the doctors had achieved before starting the protocol.

The doctors haven't yet proved that the strategy will extend lives, but they're anticipating a dramatic impact. Other recent studies indicate that complete surgical removal of visible disease doubles the chances -- to more than 60% -- that a woman will survive at least five years after diagnosis.

The idea was ""to take information that's already known and implement it into practice so we could immediately have an impact on patient survival,"" says Alpa Nick, a gynecological cancer specialist at MD Anderson and a leader of the effort to implement the protocol.

While that degree of decline was unexpected, Pantheon Macroeconomics notes openings are still up 19% from a year ago, which outpaces the 2.4% increase in payrolls over that same time. ""This is why companies report ever-increasing difficulty in finding the staff they need,"" says Pantheon's Ian Shepherdson. At this point, it isn't so much the openings that will further help the labor market, but actual hiring. There were 5.07M hires in March, versus 5.01M in February, leaving the hiring rate steady at 3.6%. (cynthia.lin@wsj.com; @cynthialin_dj)

10:29 EDT - Rackspace (RAX) is at a 3-month low following its 1Q report, which included a muted 2Q forecast and affirmed 2015 guidance. With the year's view becoming increasingly back-loaded, that's cause for concern--as it often is for investors as risks increase that guidance will ultimately get lowered as a year progresses. But a number of bulls on the cloud-computing firm don't seem overly worried. Raymond James notes RAX ""is exploring new business models that we expect to be less capital intensive and more profitable than its traditional offerings."" Stifel Nicolaus calls the stock pullback ""an overreaction"" and Pacific Crest still thinks RAX is ""a beneficiary of a growing secular shift to the cloud.""

While noting 1Q cash generation tends to be light, he affirmed 2015 guidance on that front and said expectations are that free cash will rise in 2016 and beyond, with no signs of demand for commercial jets or pricing softening.

10:20 EDT - Nomura Holdings (NMR) and RBS Securities, part of Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS), would pay about $800M, plus attorneys' fees and costs, after a US district court judge's decision Monday to grant the Federal Housing Finance Agency victory in a case involving investments made by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the housing boom. The FHFA had requested around $1.1B in damages at the outset of the trial, but Philippe Selendy, a lawyer with Quinn Emanuel who represented the FHFA at trial, said that Judge Denise Cote chose a more conservative penalty interest rate than the FHFA had requested. In an email, Selendy writes, ""This exhaustive and decisive opinion, after a full trial on the merits, puts to rest the bankers' myth that their misconduct was not a driving force of the crisis."" Nomura has said that it plans to appeal the decision. (joe.light@wsj.com; @joelight)

10:17 EDT - It's a big few days in Delaware, America's corporate capital. Today, the state Senate will vote on controversial amendments to business laws that would, among other things, give Delaware courts mandatory jurisdiction over any shareholder lawsuits involving its companies and ban those firms from adopting bylaws aimed at curbing such cases. Sound wonky? It is, but it's drawn flak from some companies and business groups who say it smacks of protectionism. The hubbub is unusual in Delaware, where recommendations of the local bar association typically go through with little debate. This, of course, is ahead of a bitter board fight coming to a head at DuPont (DD). It was founded in Delaware in 1802 and is the only Fortune 250 company still physically headquartered in the state.

10:11 EDT - There's yet-another indicator the growth rate of e-books is slowing.

10:00 EDT - The US dollar has retreated from this year's highs against the Canadian dollar and other majors, but its relative strength from a longer-term perspective is generally considered a boon for Canada. That's because a stronger US dollar means a weaker Canadian dollar, which in theory makes it easier for Canada to boost its exports to the US. But a stronger US dollar is also putting pressure on the US economy, dampening US exports. And weakness in the US also tends to spill over into Canada. It's hard to assess which impact is bigger this time, but some economists believe US demand is a more important factor for Canadian growth than the level of the loonie.

Now, Boeing (BA) has put the push--which includes tapping nontraditional suppliers and changing buying practices--front and center of its investor-day presentation. Speeding the repositioning of its defense arm, focusing R&D, boosting its service business and extending the life of existing offerings are all due to be discussed during the 3-hour event.

The former notes CAO.T has performed very well since launching a turnaround in 2013, allowing it last year to deliver its best same-store-sales growth in 8 years and sharply improved Ebitda margin. Both National Bank and RBC see organic growth continuing at Canada's third-largest restaurant operator by sales, with acquisitions boosting results further. National Bank has a C$38 target on the CAO.T while RBC's is C$35. CAO.T, which priced at C$23, is up 3% today at C$30.99. (carolyn.m.king@wsj.com; @CarolynKing1)

09:49 EDT - Orexigen Therapeutics (OREX) is discontinuing a 9,000-patient study that was designed to determine the cardiovascular risk of its Contrave diet pill. The decision was based on the recommendation of a steering committee, but was not made due to superior findings or harm to patients. The decision comes two months after the FDA publicly chastised the drug maker for unexpectedly disclosing interim study data in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Known as the LIGHT study, the cardiovascular outcomes trial was required by the FDA as a condition for receiving approval to sell its diet drug. At the time of the SEC filing, the head of the steering committee complained the interim data should not have been disclosed. OREX down 3% to $6.65. (ed.silverman@wsj.com)

Biosimilars, authorized under the Affordable Care Act, have been seen as an instrument for lowering drug spending in much the same way generics have done regarding traditional small-molecule drugs. But Cowen says biotech treatments aren't likely to face biosimilar competition--unless they have $2B in yearly sales--because of the high development and manufacturing costs. The investment bank also thinks many physicians might resist using biosimilars, either out of a lack of awareness or interchangeability between the original drug and the knockoff.

""This is why companies report ever-increasing difficulty in finding the staff they need,"" says Pantheon's Ian Shepherdson. At this point, it isn't so much the openings that will further help the labor market, but actual hiring.

10:29 EDT - Rackspace (RAX) is at a 3-month low following its 1Q report, which included a muted 2Q forecast and affirmed 2015 guidance. With the year's view becoming increasingly back-loaded, that's cause for concern--as it often is for investors as risks increase that guidance will ultimately get lowered as a year progresses. But a number of bulls on the cloud-computing firm don't seem overly worried. Raymond James notes RAX ""is exploring new business models that we expect to be less capital intensive and more profitable than its traditional offerings."" Stifel Nicolaus calls the stock pullback ""an overreaction"" and Pacific Crest still thinks RAX is ""a beneficiary of a growing secular shift to the cloud."" Shares, which had doubled the past year, are down 14% at $45.86. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

10:21 EDT - Boeing (BA) spent $2.5B on stock buybacks last quarter, so it's no surprise that repurchases remain ""a top priority"" in what CEO Jim McNerney calls the company's ""balanced"" capital deployment strategy. While noting 1Q cash generation tends to be light, he affirmed 2015 guidance on that front and said expectations are that free cash will rise in 2016 and beyond, with no signs of demand for commercial jets or pricing softening.

10:20 EDT - Nomura Holdings (NMR) and RBS Securities, part of Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS), would pay about $800M, plus attorneys' fees and costs, after a US district court judge's decision Monday to grant the Federal Housing Finance Agency victory in a case involving investments made by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the housing boom. The FHFA had requested around $1.1B in damages at the outset of the trial, but Philippe Selendy, a lawyer with Quinn Emanuel who represented the FHFA at trial, said that Judge Denise Cote chose a more conservative penalty interest rate than the FHFA had requested. In an email, Selendy writes, ""This exhaustive and decisive opinion, after a full trial on the merits, puts to rest the bankers' myth that their misconduct was not a driving force of the crisis."" Nomura has said that it plans to appeal the decision. (joe.light@wsj.com; @joelight)

10:17 EDT - It's a big few days in Delaware, America's corporate capital. Today, the state Senate will vote on controversial amendments to business laws that would, among other things, give Delaware courts mandatory jurisdiction over any shareholder lawsuits involving its companies and ban those firms from adopting bylaws aimed at curbing such cases. Sound wonky? It is, but it's drawn flak from some companies and business groups who say it smacks of protectionism. The hubbub is unusual in Delaware, where recommendations of the local bar association typically go through with little debate. This, of course, is ahead of a bitter board fight coming to a head at DuPont (DD). It was founded in Delaware in 1802 and is the only Fortune 250 company still physically headquartered in the state.

Lagardere's (MMB.FR) Hachette Livre says e-books made up 28% of its US sales in 1Q, down from 34% a year earlier, while in the UK it slipped to 36% from 40%.

10:00 EDT - The US dollar has retreated from this year's highs against the Canadian dollar and other majors, but its relative strength from a longer-term perspective is generally considered a boon for Canada. That's because a stronger US dollar means a weaker Canadian dollar, which in theory makes it easier for Canada to boost its exports to the US. But a stronger US dollar is also putting pressure on the US economy, dampening US exports. And weakness in the US also tends to spill over into Canada. It's hard to assess which impact is bigger this time, but some economists believe US demand is a more important factor for Canadian growth than the level of the loonie.

But the panel's vote marks a turning point in women's health.

The drug has been the focus of a long-running debate over the extent to which female sexual dysfunction is a genuine medical problem, whether medicines should be used for treatment and the extent to which the FDA would approve new drugs amid accusations of gender bias. ""This condition has been mired in a lot of folklore and misconceptions,"" said Cindy Whitehead, Sprout's chief executive.

The drug itself has been controversial. Flibanserin has twice been rejected by the FDA. The first time occurred in 2010, when Boehringer Ingelheim owned the medication, and the agency decided the drug wasn't sufficiently effective. The next rejection came two years ago after the FDA determined flibanserin showed only ""modest"" benefits in increasing sexual satisfaction.

Sprout responded by joining an online campaign called ""Even the Score"" that was formed with other drug makers and a coalition of consumer advocacy groups, which tried to pressure the FDA to approve more drugs to treat female sexual dysfunction. The initiative garnered some support in Congress, prompting a few lawmakers to meet with the FDA.

The campaign pushed the notion that the agency had approved more than two dozen medicines to treat erectile dysfunction but none to treat female sexual dysfunction, although the FDA has noted that there are 21 medicines already approved that contain estrogen to treat pain during sexual intercourse and vaginal dryness associated with menopause. These problems, however, are not the same as desire.

In documents filed prior to the meeting, Hylton Joffe, director of the FDA's Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products, wrote that the ""FDA rejects claims of gender bias and that such claims ""are misleading and inaccurate."" The FDA did, however, provide a path toward approval by allowing Sprout to run short-term studies to test flibanserin for signs of driving impairment after taking the pill as well as its effects when interacting with other medicines.

The FDA advisory panel was underwhelmed, though, with the overall safety and effectiveness data demonstrated in the various studies that Sprout submitted. For instance, dizziness occurred nearly five times among women on the drug compared with a placebo. And sleepiness occurred more than three times as often, while fainting occurred twice as often on the drug.

The panel also expressed concerns over interactions with drinking alcohol. And while the drug showed a statistically significant improvement in the number of satisfying sexual events, the increase in desire was measured on a monthly, not a daily basis. Moreover, panel members noted the improvements were modest.

""It's exciting we'll have this in our armorarium… but we all wish it was a better drug,"" said panel member Amy Whitaker, an assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Chicago.

""As a feminist, I'm delighted people are taking women's sexual issues seriously, but recommending approval for this drug isn't the correct response,"" said Cindy Pearson, executive director of the National Women's Health Network. ""This sets a low bar.""

But the panel's vote marks a turning point in women's health.

The drug has been the focus of a long-running debate over the extent to which female sexual dysfunction is a genuine medical problem, whether medicines should be used for treatment and the extent to which the FDA would approve new drugs amid accusations of gender bias. ""This condition has been mired in a lot of folklore and misconceptions,"" said Cindy Whitehead, Sprout's chief executive.

The drug itself has been controversial. Flibanserin has twice been rejected by the FDA. The first time occurred in 2010, when Boehringer Ingelheim owned the medication, and the agency decided the drug wasn't sufficiently effective. The next rejection came two years ago after the FDA determined flibanserin showed only ""modest"" benefits in increasing sexual satisfaction.

Sprout responded by joining an online campaign called ""Even the Score"" that was formed with other drug makers and a coalition of consumer advocacy groups, which tried to pressure the FDA to approve more drugs to treat female sexual dysfunction. The initiative garnered some support in Congress, prompting a few lawmakers to meet with the FDA.

LANSING, Mich., June 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Neogen has released an enhanced version of its popular AccuPoint(R) ATP Hygiene Monitoring System that makes the product the most sensitive and consistent hygiene monitoring test system available.

Neogen's new AccuPoint Advanced ATP Hygiene Monitoring System features samplers with new technology to more consistently collect any potential residues left behind after sanitation efforts; an enhanced compact instrument to better detect any residues collected by the samplers; and user-friendly data management software to organize and analyze the system's test results.

""While the previous versions of our AccuPoint system have been very successful tools to monitor the effectiveness of the sanitation programs of our numerous customers, the feedback we've received led directly to this next generation of our AccuPoint system,"" said Ed Bradley, Neogen's vice president of Food Safety. ""Our many years of working closely with the food industry, and other producers of consumer products, have shown us what product features matter. We are very pleased to offer a new sanitation testing system that we believe is superior to anything else in the market.""

Improvements include: 


   -- Improved sampler chemistry to produce more consistent results with even 
      greater sensitivity -- and the ability to be stored at room temperature 
      for up to two weeks; 
 
   -- An enhanced instrument to produce even faster results (less than 20 
      seconds); 
 
   -- Advanced Data Manager software to easily streamline the testing process 
      by creating test plans and syncing important data, while keeping a 
      permanent record of hygiene test results. 

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) sanitation monitoring systems have evolved into the current ""gold standard"" for food and beverage production facilities to monitor their sanitation efforts. Using an ATP system is an easy and quick gauge of a facility's cleanliness, and is easily customized for the specific equipment, people, product, and processes used in any food production facility. The systems set an objective, recordable, and traceable standard to help avoid the consequences of substandard sanitation efforts.

Neogen Corporation develops and markets products dedicated to food and animal safety. The company's Food Safety Division markets dehydrated culture media, and diagnostic test kits to detect foodborne bacteria, natural toxins, food allergens, drug residues, plant diseases and sanitation concerns. Neogen's Animal Safety Division is a leader in the development of animal genomics along with the manufacturing and distribution of a variety of animal healthcare products, including diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, veterinary instruments, wound care and disinfectants.

Aerie's glaucoma treatment, called Rhopressa, is a once-a-day eye drop that targets the diseased tissue responsible for the elevated intraocular pressures that result in glaucoma.

Under the pact with the FDA, Aerie is changing its primary endpoint to include patients with baseline intraocular pressures ranging from above 20 millimeters of mercury to below 25 millimeters of mercury.

The new range is the same as an earlier trial of Rhopressa, in which the drug showed it was at least equally effective as a current glaucoma treatment.

Aerie said the new endpoint range wouldn't require additional patients for the current trial.

Previously, the trial's range included patients with baseline intraocular pressures ranging from above 20 millimeters of mercury to below 27 millimeters of mercury. Aerie said the previous range will now represent a secondary endpoint range for the trial.

The company said three-month efficacy results from the current trial are expected by the third quarter.

Additionally, Aerie said it expected to start another late-stage trial for Rhopressa in the third quarter.

FLKS plans to launch the drink in 1H. Shares are slightly higher today. (ron.winslow@wsj.com; @ronwinslow)

13:34 EDT - UBS hops aboard Kansas City Southern (KSU) saying a valuation ""reset has largely played out."" It ups KSU to buy from neutral pointing to its underperformace against its peers and a relative P/E well below the long term averages of both the S&P and the rail group. With the stock down 22% YTD, UBS thinks shares are now attractive for several reasons including the fact that KSU's coal exposure is declining while long term growth drivers remain intact. Expansion of Mexico's largest seaport plus output from new auto plants there should play into the recovery scenario as should demand from new plastics plants expected to open in the Gulf Coast region in 2017. KSU is up 2.8% at $94.20. (patrick.sheridan@wsj.com; @patmsheridan)

13:32 EDT - Showtime officially launches its stand-alone streaming service, giving consumers the opportunity to subscribe to the CBS-owned offering without first having to buy large packages of cable channels. The Showtime service is currently available on Apple TV and other Apple (AAPL) devices as well as the Roku streaming platform. The $10.99/month price also includes access to Showtime library content. Rival HBO, owned by Time Warner (TWX), launched a similar service earlier this year. (joseph.flint@wsj.com; @JBFlint)

13:26 EDT - AI is becoming a hot business. So hot, in fact, it's now got its own nickname: AIAAS--that's Artificial Intelligence as a Service. Amazon (AMZN) is offering developers without AI skills its machine-learning software, which can run predictions on huge data sets of everything from market prices to future clothing trends. Narrative Science, an AI company from Chicago, is offering newspapers a robot-storywriting service based on sports and market data. Yseop, a business-intelligence firm, offers enterprises a quick turnaround of insights gleaned from massive amounts of data. ""Businesses wouldn't use a Rolodex to manage contacts or a fax machine for real-time interoffice communication, so why are some still relying on manually written BI reports to understand data?"" says Yseop marketing exec Arden Manning.

13:22 EDT - The movie business is famously hit-driven. But a blockbuster can also go a long way in the book business. Take Barnes & Noble (BKS). It is rolling out the red carpet for next Tuesday's release of ""Go Set a Watchman"" by Harper Lee. The bookseller's stores will host a ""read-a-thon"" of her classic ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" on Monday and open early the next day. Customers purchasing ""Watchman"" before 10am will receive a free coffee, with the first 20 getting a reusable tote bag. While not exactly an Oscars goodie bag, that may still seem a lot of hoopla. But ""Watchman"" has been BKS' most pre-ordered book this year. Moreover, history shows a hit novel can have a big impact on the company's results; in August 2012, it cited the ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" series as a reason for strong retail revenue growth. Of course, what a hit book giveth, it can also taketh away. A year later, BKS blamed a sharp retail-revenue decrease in part on a dearth of new titles matching ""Grey."" Perhaps the tote bag will encourage ""Watchman"" fans to keep stocking up. (miriam.gottfried@wsj.com; @miriamgottfried)

13:18 EDT - Investors yesterday sneered at Humana's (HUM) deal to sell to Aetna (AET), bumping up the stock a smidge to $188.96 when the offer at day's end was worth $223.35/share. Amid today's broader market drop, HUM is outpacing the declines with its 1.3% fall to $186.47, putting the stock below Thursday's close of $187.50. Essentially, right now HUM shareholders were better off before the holiday-weekend deal than they are today. Meanwhile, AET is down another 2.4%, at $114.60. That cuts the deal value to $220.98.

13:12 EDT - The lingering downturn in crude prices could exacerbate a looming problem for the oil-and-gas industry: replacing the large number of baby boomers likely to retire the next few years. ""Given the carnage currently unfolding, it will be difficult to attract a new labor pool back into the industry,"" says Simmons & Co. It's an issue, in large part, because of the many jobs lost during the 1980s' oil bust. Few later re-entered the field, leading to a small pool of mid-career professionals working in the space today.

13:09 EDT - A $24B sale of 3-year Treasurys drew mixed demand at a time US stocks were paring their a selloff. The auctioned yield--0.932%--is the lowest since April for a 3-year sale, and that dented some buying interest. Overall demand--a 3.16 bid-to-cover ratio--was the lowest since August. But the direct bid at 13.9% was the most since January. Indirect remained decent at 47.4%, though that was lower than the 51.1% average of the past 4 sales. The rally in the bond market also eases a bit--the 10-year yield is at 2.224% versus 2.28% Monday. (min.zeng@wsj.com; @minzengwsj)

13:06 EDT - Puerto Rico's $72B in debt is 1/4 of Greece's level, but BlackRock's Jeffrey Rosenberg notes a debt restructuring for the former would have greater significance to US retailer investors due to the concentrated nature of such folks in muni bonds. Puerto Rico is that market's 6th-biggest issuer, and given its triple tax-exempt status the island's debt is found in a disproportionate amount of US investors' fixed-income portfolios.

13:03 EDT - General Mills (GIS) is joining a growing list of food companies pledging to buy eggs only from cage-free hens in the US amid growing pressure from consumer groups over the egg industry's decades-long use of small cages to house birds. GIS says in a new animal-welfare policy that it can't yet give a timeline for the change. It notes the recent avian-flu outbreak that has curtailed US egg supplies ""has been deeply disruptive"" to suppliers, so it will work with them on a ""reasonable timeline toward this commitment."" The company uses eggs in a variety of its packaged-food products, such as Pillsbury cookie dough. Starbucks, Nestle, Aramark and other food providers previously announced plans to move away from ""caged"" eggs. (david.kesmodel@wsj.com; @davidkesmodel)

13:00 EDT - America's 3 major Macau-exposed casino stocks get off the mat today despite the broader market's slide as Credit Suisse calls a bottom to the sharp gambling declines seen on the Chinese island the past year. ""We see a fundamental shift towards supportive policy (from both Macau and the central government), and seasonally stronger months are ahead."" With lots of bad news already priced in, the investment bank upgrades MGM, WYNN and Sands (LVS) to outperform as it expects Macau gambling revenue to rebound faster in 2016 than it previously did. MGM and LVS climb 3% while WYNN jumps 5% to sit atop the S&P 500. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

Of course, what a hit book giveth, it can also taketh away. A year later, BKS blamed a sharp retail-revenue decrease in part on a dearth of new titles matching ""Grey."" Perhaps the tote bag will encourage ""Watchman"" fans to keep stocking up. (miriam.gottfried@wsj.com; @miriamgottfried)

13:18 EDT - Investors yesterday sneered at Humana's (HUM) deal to sell to Aetna (AET), bumping up the stock a smidge to $188.96 when the offer at day's end was worth $223.35/share. Amid today's broader market drop, HUM is outpacing the declines with its 1.3% fall to $186.47, putting the stock below Thursday's close of $187.50. Essentially, right now HUM shareholders were better off before the holiday-weekend deal than they are today. Meanwhile, AET is down another 2.4%, at $114.60. That cuts the deal value to $220.98.

13:12 EDT - The lingering downturn in crude prices could exacerbate a looming problem for the oil-and-gas industry: replacing the large number of baby boomers likely to retire the next few years. ""Given the carnage currently unfolding, it will be difficult to attract a new labor pool back into the industry,"" says Simmons & Co. It's an issue, in large part, because of the many jobs lost during the 1980s' oil bust. Few later re-entered the field, leading to a small pool of mid-career professionals working in the space today.

13:09 EDT - A $24B sale of 3-year Treasurys drew mixed demand at a time US stocks were paring their a selloff. The auctioned yield--0.932%--is the lowest since April for a 3-year sale, and that dented some buying interest. Overall demand--a 3.16 bid-to-cover ratio--was the lowest since August. But the direct bid at 13.9% was the most since January. Indirect remained decent at 47.4%, though that was lower than the 51.1% average of the past 4 sales. The rally in the bond market also eases a bit--the 10-year yield is at 2.224% versus 2.28% Monday. (min.zeng@wsj.com; @minzengwsj)

13:06 EDT - Puerto Rico's $72B in debt is 1/4 of Greece's level, but BlackRock's Jeffrey Rosenberg notes a debt restructuring for the former would have greater significance to US retailer investors due to the concentrated nature of such folks in muni bonds. Puerto Rico is that market's 6th-biggest issuer, and given its triple tax-exempt status the island's debt is found in a disproportionate amount of US investors' fixed-income portfolios.

13:03 EDT - General Mills (GIS) is joining a growing list of food companies pledging to buy eggs only from cage-free hens in the US amid growing pressure from consumer groups over the egg industry's decades-long use of small cages to house birds. GIS says in a new animal-welfare policy that it can't yet give a timeline for the change. It notes the recent avian-flu outbreak that has curtailed US egg supplies ""has been deeply disruptive"" to suppliers, so it will work with them on a ""reasonable timeline toward this commitment."" The company uses eggs in a variety of its packaged-food products, such as Pillsbury cookie dough. Starbucks, Nestle, Aramark and other food providers previously announced plans to move away from ""caged"" eggs. (david.kesmodel@wsj.com; @davidkesmodel)

13:00 EDT - America's 3 major Macau-exposed casino stocks get off the mat today despite the broader market's slide as Credit Suisse calls a bottom to the sharp gambling declines seen on the Chinese island the past year. ""We see a fundamental shift towards supportive policy (from both Macau and the central government), and seasonally stronger months are ahead."" With lots of bad news already priced in, the investment bank upgrades MGM, WYNN and Sands (LVS) to outperform as it expects Macau gambling revenue to rebound faster in 2016 than it previously did. MGM and LVS climb 3% while WYNN jumps 5% to sit atop the S&P 500. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

MENLO PARK, Calif., July 28, 2015

MENLO PARK, Calif., July 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Nevro Corp. (NYSE: NVRO), a global medical device company that is providing innovative evidence-based solutions for the treatment of chronic pain, today announced the publication of the SENZA-RCT results in the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the official Journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists.

The SENZA-RCT pivotal study was a ground-breaking study that was the first to directly compare spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapies. The multicenter study compared the safety and effectiveness of HF10(TM) therapy to traditional SCS therapy. The study enrolled 241 patients across 11 U.S. clinical trial sites (171 patients received SCS implants at 10 sites), making it the largest prospective randomized SCS study ever conducted to assess the treatment of chronic back and leg pain.

The Senza(R) SCS system received FDA approval in May of 2015. The results of the SENZA-RCT, first presented at the North American Neuromodulation Society meeting in December of 2014, provided the evidentiary basis for HF10 therapy's superiority labeling from FDA, a first in the SCS space. Additional information, including 18-month data from the SENZA-RCT, will be presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the International Spine Intervention Society on July 29(th) , 2015.

The full SENZA-RCT publication is available by subscription at http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/onlinefirst.aspx.

About the Senza System and HF10 Therapy

The Senza system is the only SCS system that delivers Nevro's proprietary HF10 therapy, an SCS therapy that provides electrical pulses to the spinal cord to alleviate pain. The electrical pulses are delivered by small electrodes on leads that are placed near the spinal cord and are connected to a compact, battery-powered generator implanted under the skin. HF10 therapy is the only SCS therapy indicated to provide pain relief without paresthesia (a stimulation-induced sensation, such as tingling or buzzing, which is the basis of traditional SCS) and is also the first SCS therapy to demonstrate superiority to traditional SCS for back and leg pain in a comparative pivotal study. Nevro's innovations in SCS, including the Senza(R) system and HF10(TM) therapy, are covered by more than 75 issued U.S. and international patents.

About Nevro

MENLO PARK, Calif., July 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Nevro Corp. (NYSE: NVRO), a global medical device company that is providing innovative evidence-based solutions for the treatment of chronic pain, today announced the publication of the SENZA-RCT results in the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the official Journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists.

The SENZA-RCT pivotal study was a ground-breaking study that was the first to directly compare spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapies. The multicenter study compared the safety and effectiveness of HF10(TM) therapy to traditional SCS therapy. The study enrolled 241 patients across 11 U.S. clinical trial sites (171 patients received SCS implants at 10 sites), making it the largest prospective randomized SCS study ever conducted to assess the treatment of chronic back and leg pain.

The Senza(R) SCS system received FDA approval in May of 2015. The results of the SENZA-RCT, first presented at the North American Neuromodulation Society meeting in December of 2014, provided the evidentiary basis for HF10 therapy's superiority labeling from FDA, a first in the SCS space. Additional information, including 18-month data from the SENZA-RCT, will be presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the International Spine Intervention Society on July 29(th) , 2015.

About the Senza System and HF10 Therapy

The Senza system is the only SCS system that delivers Nevro's proprietary HF10 therapy, an SCS therapy that provides electrical pulses to the spinal cord to alleviate pain. The electrical pulses are delivered by small electrodes on leads that are placed near the spinal cord and are connected to a compact, battery-powered generator implanted under the skin. HF10 therapy is the only SCS therapy indicated to provide pain relief without paresthesia (a stimulation-induced sensation, such as tingling or buzzing, which is the basis of traditional SCS) and is also the first SCS therapy to demonstrate superiority to traditional SCS for back and leg pain in a comparative pivotal study. Nevro's innovations in SCS, including the Senza(R) system and HF10(TM) therapy, are covered by more than 75 issued U.S. and international patents.

""With Plains' outlook for 2H and 2016 more cautious and market conditions remaining very difficult as storage levels remain far above average, production growth remains resilient and new competitor infrastructure comes online,"" the investment bank notes PAA ""opened the door"" to a lack of equityholder-distribution growth until 2017.

13:13 EDT - The expected 215K gain in payrolls last month will have to come with signs of rising wages for investors to be satisfied with tomorrow's report. Average hourly earnings disappointed last month by coming in flat. One force keeping wage gains in check is the mining and logging sector, where jobs have declined each month of 2015. The sector pays an above-average wage, so losses there works against the hoped-for pickup in wage growth. By contrast, the lower-paying leisure and hospitality sector has been a key contributor to job creation. (cynthia.lin@wsj.com; @cynthialin_dj)

12:51 EDT - Small-business hiring was flat in July from June, according to a survey out today by the National Federation of Independent Business -- one sign suggesting Friday's jobs report could underwhelm. But overall, the combination of more job openings and more firms finding it difficult to fill open posts suggest the labor market is getting tighter, says NFIB chief economist William Dunkelberg. The survey says a quarter of respondents have slots they haven't been able to fill, up slightly from June. Meanwhile, companies planning to add jobs rose three points, to 12%, reversing last month's decline. (lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com)

12:48 EDT - Though wage growth has been the missing piece of the job market recovery, today's NFIB survey suggests small-business employees are starting to get raises. A seasonally adjusted 23% of small-business owners reported raising compensation in July, and the net number planning to lift wages rose four points from June to a net 15%, according to the organization's chief economist. Still, small-business owners planning to lift wages tracks below the recovery-highs notched in January and May, says NFIB. (lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com)

12:47 EDT - Private-equity firms need a new champion. Steve Judge, CEO of industry lobbying group Private Equity Growth Capital Council, will step down Aug. 15. Sponsored initially by some of the largest firms in the industry, the trade body has been tasked with managing the industry's image among law makers, preserving friendly legislation such as the deductibility of business debt and fending off attempts by both Republicans and Democrats to change the way that its profits are taxed. Judge faced his biggest battle less than a year into his tenure when P-E came under fire from Democratic contenders and Republic rivals criticizing nominee Mitt Romney's time at Bain Capital.

""This is a question about how much the ad industry is prepared to be open-minded. But as platforms come together, I think this opportunity looms.""

Still, small-business owners planning to lift wages tracks below the recovery-highs notched in January and May, says NFIB. (lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com)

12:47 EDT - Private-equity firms need a new champion. Steve Judge, CEO of industry lobbying group Private Equity Growth Capital Council, will step down Aug. 15. Sponsored initially by some of the largest firms in the industry, the trade body has been tasked with managing the industry's image among law makers, preserving friendly legislation such as the deductibility of business debt and fending off attempts by both Republicans and Democrats to change the way that its profits are taxed. Judge faced his biggest battle less than a year into his tenure when P-E came under fire from Democratic contenders and Republic rivals criticizing nominee Mitt Romney's time at Bain Capital.

12:45 EDT - New York Times Co. (NYT) CEO Mark Thompson says that as the company pushes to produce more video content, it's hopeful it can eat into TV's ad revenue as viewers increasingly migrate from cable to online. ""This is a question about how much the ad industry is prepared to be open-minded. But as platforms come together, I think this opportunity looms."" NYT reported a 14% increase in 2Q digital-ad revenue amid strong gains in video and paid posts. But that couldn't come close to offsetting the 13% slide in print-ad revenue. Shares are down 3.4% at $12.74, hitting a 6 1/2-month low. (lukas.alpert@wsj.com; @lalpert1)

ROCKVILLE, Md., Aug. 12, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: RGRX) (""the Company"" or ""RegeneRx""), a clinical-stage drug development company focused on tissue protection, repair and regeneration, today announced a new peer-reviewed publication describing Thymosin beta 4's (TB4) effects on dry eye syndrome and its potential value for the treatment of other ophthalmic disorders. The authors of the paper explained how TB4's reported mechanisms of action help alleviate the signs and symptoms of dry eye by promoting stem cell recruitment and cell migration, reducing inflammation and apoptosis, enhancing cytoprotection, and promoting gene expression. These multiple activities are responsible for a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of dry eye disorders. Current treatments aim to keep the eye moist and let the natural repair process function, which can take months, if at all. RGN-259, TB4 formulated as a sterile, preservative-free eye drop, is designed to protect and repair the injured dry eye and improve the rate and degree of healing. It is currently in late clinical trials.

The authors also addressed additional ocular disorders that may be improved with TB4 treatment. These are based on the defined mechanisms of action of the molecule in the eye and include blepharitis, graft vs. host disease, limbal stem cell deficiency, and following eye surgery such as post-refractive surgery.

The paper was authored by Drs. Gabriel Sosne and Hynda K. Kleinman and published in the scientific journal, IOVS, 2015 Aug; 56(9):5110-7. Both researchers are consultants to RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.

ROCKVILLE, Md., Aug. 12, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: RGRX) (""the Company"" or ""RegeneRx""), a clinical-stage drug development company focused on tissue protection, repair and regeneration, today announced a new peer-reviewed publication describing Thymosin beta 4's (TB4) effects on dry eye syndrome and its potential value for the treatment of other ophthalmic disorders. The authors of the paper explained how TB4's reported mechanisms of action help alleviate the signs and symptoms of dry eye by promoting stem cell recruitment and cell migration, reducing inflammation and apoptosis, enhancing cytoprotection, and promoting gene expression. These multiple activities are responsible for a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of dry eye disorders. Current treatments aim to keep the eye moist and let the natural repair process function, which can take months, if at all. RGN-259, TB4 formulated as a sterile, preservative-free eye drop, is designed to protect and repair the injured dry eye and improve the rate and degree of healing. It is currently in late clinical trials.

The authors also addressed additional ocular disorders that may be improved with TB4 treatment. These are based on the defined mechanisms of action of the molecule in the eye and include blepharitis, graft vs. host disease, limbal stem cell deficiency, and following eye surgery such as post-refractive surgery.

The paper was authored by Drs. Gabriel Sosne and Hynda K. Kleinman and published in the scientific journal, IOVS, 2015 Aug; 56(9):5110-7. Both researchers are consultants to RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 30, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zogenix, Inc. (Nasdaq:ZGNX), a pharmaceutical company developing therapies for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced positive top-line pharmacokinetic results from its Phase 1b multi-dose clinical trial of Relday(TM) , a proprietary, once-monthly subcutaneous investigational formulation of risperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia. If approved, Relday has the potential to be the first subcutaneous antipsychotic product that achieves therapeutic drug levels on the first day of administration, allows for once-monthly dosing and does not require reconstitution. Zogenix has retained Locust Walk Partners of Cambridge, MA, a transaction advisory firm for life sciences companies, to provide transaction advisory and support services for Relday, and has now initiated efforts to secure a global strategic development and commercialization partner for Relday.

The Phase 1b multi-dose parallel group clinical trial enrolled 60 subjects comprised of three cohorts of patients receiving four monthly injections of Relday, at dose levels of either 60, 90 or 120 mg of risperidone per month. A fourth cohort received five bi-weekly intramuscular injections of Risperdal(R) Consta(R) . Risperdal Consta requires oral supplementation for the first three weeks following dosing initiation, and requires at least four doses to reach steady state. The results for Relday demonstrated that risperidone plasma concentrations in the therapeutic range were achieved on the first day of dosing, reached steady state levels following the second dose and consistently maintained therapeutic levels throughout the four-month period. In addition, dose proportionality was confirmed across the dose range intended for clinical practice (60 to 120 mg). Relday was generally safe and well-tolerated, with results consistent with the profile of risperidone and the Company's previous Phase 1 single-dose clinical trial.

""With the positive top-line results from the Phase 1b multi-dose trial, Relday is now well-positioned to begin a Phase 3 program once a development and commercialization partner is secured,"" said Stephen Farr, Ph.D., President and CEO of Zogenix. ""Our market research indicates that Relday, if approved, has the potential to address a medical need within the schizophrenia treatment landscape by becoming the first monthly subcutaneous antipsychotic product that achieves therapeutic drug levels on the first day of administration, thereby eliminating the need for loading dose regimens upon therapy initiation or following a missed dose.""

Risperidone is one of the most widely prescribed medications used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia in adults and teenagers 13 years of age and older. The injectable formulation of risperidone, Risperdal Consta, requires twice-a-month dosing, oral supplementation during therapy initiation, intramuscular injection and drug reconstitution prior to use.

About Relday(TM)

If approved, Relday has the potential to be the first subcutaneous antipsychotic product that allows for once-monthly dosing and achieves therapeutic drug levels on the first day of administration. Zogenix believes that Relday will offer an improved pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, significant reduction in injection volume and a simplified dosing regimen (e.g., no need for loading dose) due to DURECT's (Nasdaq:DRRX) SABER(R) controlled-release depot technology. In July 2011, Zogenix licensed from DURECT exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize this proprietary formulation which utilizes DURECT's SABER(R) depot technology.

The Phase 1b multi-dose clinical trial for Relday was conducted as a single-center, open-label, safety and PK trial of 60 patients with chronic, stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder across a dose range of 60, 90 and 120 mg, and included a comparator arm of Risperdal Consta.

About Zogenix

Zogenix, Inc. (Nasdaq:ZGNX) is a pharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing CNS therapies that address specific clinical needs for people living with orphan and other CNS disorders who need innovative treatment alternatives to help them return to normal daily functioning.

Bristol-Myers also is studying its Yervoy-Opdivo combination in lung cancer, which has a bigger patient population than melanoma.

""What we don't want to see is that cost becomes a factor in people getting the best kind of care that's available,"" said Tim Turnham, executive director of the nonprofit Melanoma Research Foundation.

He said it is difficult to assess whether the cost of the Bristol-Myers combination is justifiable because the magnitude of the treatment's benefit on patient survival isn't yet known. So far, studies have shown that it shrinks tumors and delays the time until either tumor progression or death compared with its component drugs alone.

A Bristol-Myers spokeswoman said ""long-term survival, which is ultimately our goal and that of patients, should be given appropriate and significant consideration in assessing value."" She added that only patients who continue to respond to the therapy stay on treatment.

Other expensive combinations have also hit the market. A two-drug melanoma regimen from Novartis AG costs about $18,869 for a 30-day supply, or roughly $226,428 per patient if taken for a year. A Novartis spokeswoman said studies have shown the combination prolongs patient survival.

The FDA based its approval of the Yervoy-Opdivo combination on a Bristol-funded study that showed the regimen significantly shrank tumors in 60% of melanoma patients, versus 11% of patients receiving Yervoy alone. The median time from start of treatment until disease progression or death—also known as progression-free survival—was 8.9 months among those receiving the combination, versus 4.7 months in the Yervoy-alone group.

""It is the first example of an immuno-oncology treatment that could produce an objective [tumor] response in the majority of patients,"" said Jedd Wolchok, chief of melanoma and immunotherapies service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, and a leader of several studies of the combined treatments.

The combination also increased the risk of serious adverse events such as the gastrointestinal disorder colitis.

Dr. Wolchok said oncologists in community practices may need some education in managing the side effects, which are different from those resulting from chemotherapy and other cancer drugs. The new combination requires oncologists and nurses ""to pay attention to toxicity so it can be reversed quickly,"" said Dr. Wolchok, who is a consultant for Bristol-Myers and whose institution gets grant support from the company.

A patient receiving the combination therapy takes both drugs for the first 12 weeks and then Yervoy treatment is stopped. The patient continues taking Opdivo until experiencing disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The cost for the initial 12-week phase of the combination is about $141,000, and then $12,500 a month for Opdivo alone, totaling roughly $256,000 if a patient stays on therapy for a year, according to a Bristol-Myers spokeswoman. Subsequent full-year costs of therapy would be about $150,000 for Opdivo alone.

Yervoy, which was introduced in 2011, generated $621 million in sales for Bristol in the first half of this year. Opdivo, launched late last year, had $162 million in sales for the same period.

Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said Thursday the FDA approved the use of its drugs Yervoy and Opdivo for the treatment of advanced melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer.

Bristol-Myers also is studying its Yervoy-Opdivo combination in lung cancer, which has a bigger patient population than melanoma.

""What we don't want to see is that cost becomes a factor in people getting the best kind of care that's available,"" said Tim Turnham, executive director of the nonprofit Melanoma Research Foundation.

He said it is difficult to assess whether the cost of the Bristol-Myers combination is justifiable because the magnitude of the treatment's benefit on patient survival isn't yet known. So far, studies have shown that it shrinks tumors and delays the time until either tumor progression or death compared with its component drugs alone.

A Bristol-Myers spokeswoman said ""long-term survival, which is ultimately our goal and that of patients, should be given appropriate and significant consideration in assessing value."" She added that only patients who continue to respond to the therapy stay on treatment.

Other expensive combinations have also hit the market. A two-drug melanoma regimen from Novartis AG costs about $18,869 for a 30-day supply, or roughly $226,428 per patient if taken for a year. A Novartis spokeswoman said studies have shown the combination prolongs patient survival.

The FDA based its approval of the Yervoy-Opdivo combination on a Bristol-funded study that showed the regimen significantly shrank tumors in 60% of melanoma patients, versus 11% of patients receiving Yervoy alone. The median time from start of treatment until disease progression or death—also known as progression-free survival—was 8.9 months among those receiving the combination, versus 4.7 months in the Yervoy-alone group.

""It is the first example of an immuno-oncology treatment that could produce an objective [tumor] response in the majority of patients,"" said Jedd Wolchok, chief of melanoma and immunotherapies service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, and a leader of several studies of the combined treatments.

The combination also increased the risk of serious adverse events such as the gastrointestinal disorder colitis.

Dr. Wolchok said oncologists in community practices may need some education in managing the side effects, which are different from those resulting from chemotherapy and other cancer drugs. The new combination requires oncologists and nurses ""to pay attention to toxicity so it can be reversed quickly,"" said Dr. Wolchok, who is a consultant for Bristol-Myers and whose institution gets grant support from the company.

A patient receiving the combination therapy takes both drugs for the first 12 weeks and then Yervoy treatment is stopped. The patient continues taking Opdivo until experiencing disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The cost for the initial 12-week phase of the combination is about $141,000, and then $12,500 a month for Opdivo alone, totaling roughly $256,000 if a patient stays on therapy for a year, according to a Bristol-Myers spokeswoman.

WOONSOCKET, R.I., Oct. 5, 2015

WOONSOCKET, R.I., Oct. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) today announced that it is opening Hearing Centers in seven CVS/pharmacy stores in the Dallas and Cleveland markets and will be providing optical services at CVS/pharmacy in five store locations around the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. market.

""Hearing and optical services are a great fit with the existing health offerings in our stores, including industry-leading pharmacy products and services, our MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics and a comprehensive smoking cessation program,"" said Andrew Sussman, M.D., president of CVS/minuteclinic and executive vice president & associate chief medical officer of CVS Health. ""By expanding our retail health offerings into vision and hearing services, we are providing customers a convenient, single destination on their path to better health.""

""Over the past year, we have eliminated tobacco products from all of our stores, added healthy food options, and created a stronger connection between health and beauty,"" said Judy Sansone, senior vice president of front store business and chief merchant of CVS Health. ""Now, by taking these first steps into providing hearing and optical services, we continue to evolve our retail locations into a leading destination for convenient and accessible health services.""

The Hearing Centers at CVS/pharmacy, which will be open Tuesdays to Saturdays, are staffed by licensed audiologists and hearing instrument specialists who are able to assess hearing needs using computerized equipment in the centers' soundproof booths. The centers will offer a variety of hearing aid products and custom ear plugs, as well as provide services such as free hearing screenings and free in-store hearing checks and cleanings. The Hearing Centers will also offer innovative noise simulation testing to demonstrate to patients the improvements that hearing aids can provide during different life experiences. Many insurance plans will be accepted for the hearing services available.

Experts say it takes an average of seven years for consumers to seek help from a professional for their hearing loss[1]. The hearing services offered at CVS/pharmacy will help increase awareness and access for those with hearing needs and provide the opportunity to improve their quality of life by addressing their hearing needs sooner.

Optical service at CVS/pharmacy will be available seven days a week later this fall at select locations around the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. market. Services will include comprehensive eye exams by an optometrist three days a week for both walk-ins and appointments; prescriptions for glasses and contact lenses; access to more than 600 styles of frames and sunglasses from fashionable, popular brands for women, men and children; and free cleanings and adjustments. Many insurance plans will be accepted.

All eyeglasses will have a 90-day total-satisfaction guarantee, and can be returned for any reason during this period for a full refund. Glasses purchased for children up to age 14 will be covered by a one-year guarantee[2].

VEEVA SYSTEMS UNVEILS CLINICAL TRIALS STUDY START-UP SOLUTION

Top 20 pharma and top 10 global CRO sign on as first Veeva Vault Study Start-Up customers

At the Veeva 2015 R&D Summit today, Veeva Systems announced the first fully integrated clinical trials study start-up solution. Veeva Vault Study Start-Up will enable life sciences organizations to manage both the content and the activities associated with activating sites for clinical trials. This comprehensive solution will accelerate time to first patient enrollment, automate manual processes, and deliver seamless interoperability with eTMF for a single source of trial-related content.

Life sciences organizations have made strides in adopting advanced solutions to increase speed and efficiency in many areas of the trial process. According to the 2015 TMF Reference Model Survey, a majority of respondents (61%) are either using or actively planning on using an eTMF. And according to the Veeva 2015 Paperless TMF Survey, speeding study start-up is cited by 56% of the respondents as a top driver of eTMF adoption in their organization.

""The life sciences industry has long struggled with manual and inefficient processes for study start-up,"" said Kathryn King, vice president of Vault Clinical at Veeva. ""Existing solutions managed either documents or start-up activities, but never both together. This created significant challenges in identifying and addressing issues during start-up, resulting in longer study durations and impacting overall time to market.""

Traditional solutions exacerbated the problem by focusing on either site start-up documentation or site initiation data, but were unable to bring the documents and data together. Further, these systems were often disconnected from the eTMF applications that also needed that information as part of the trial's history. The fragmented landscape contributed to lengthy site initiation timelines, a process that, on average, took 17 months to complete, according to research from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development.

""Sponsors and CROs have typically used unsophisticated, disparate, and incompatible proprietary and customized approaches and eClinical solutions to manage study start-up and initiation activities,"" said Ken Getz, associate professor at CSDD Tufts University School of Medicine. ""This has contributed to the historically high level of inefficiency and inconsistency that we've observed in investigative site engagement and activation.""

Vault Study Start-Up will bring together site start-up documents and site initiation in a single solution, while providing seamless interoperability with Veeva Vault eTMF. This combination of capabilities will ensure a single source of truth for all start-up related content and data. Sites, sponsors, and CROs will be able to access the same clinical information, simplifying collaboration and increasing efficiency. Vault Study Start-Up will also provide advanced capabilities to better manage start-up processes, including a complete, reliable electronic audit trail.

Veeva Vault Study Start-Up will be available in early December 2015. A top 20 pharmaceutical company and a top 10 global CRO have already signed on as early Vault Study Start-Up customers.

Veeva Vault RIM was also announced today at the 2015 Veeva R&D Summit. Vault RIM is a next-generation regulatory information management suite that unites submission documents, published dossiers, product registrations, and agency commitments into a single authoritative source for the global organization.

HOUSTON, TX and VANCOUVER, Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - ESSA Pharma Inc. (""ESSA"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: EPI; NASDAQ: EPIX) announced today that the first patient has been enrolled in ESSA's Phase 1/2 clinical study of EPI-506 as a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (""mCRPC"").

In the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, ESSA intends to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated-dose, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of EPI-506 in prostate cancer patients who have failed abiraterone or enzalutamide or both, the current standard-of-care drugs in mCRPC. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 150 subjects across the United States and Canada.

""Patients with metastatic CRPC who have failed abiraterone and/or enzalutamide currently represent a large unmet medical need,"" said Dr. Frank Perabo, ESSA's Chief Medical Officer. ""The novel mechanism of action of EPI-506 was developed specifically to overcome resistance to these current drugs.""

As part of the clinical study, ESSA will collect molecular biomarker information which may provide useful context in understanding patient outcomes. Androgen receptor splice variant V7 data will be included in such information.

Details relating to the Phase 1/2 clinical trial are now available on the US National Institutes of Health clinical trials website (https://clinicaltrials.gov).

About ESSA Pharma Inc.

ESSA Pharma is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer (""CRPC"") in patients whose disease is progressing despite treatment with current therapies. ESSA believes that its product candidate, EPI-506, can significantly expand the interval of time in which patients suffering from CRPC can benefit from hormone-based therapies. EPI-506 acts by disrupting the androgen receptor (""AR"") signaling pathway, which is the primary pathway that drives prostate cancer growth. We have shown that EPI-002, the primary metabolite of EPI-506, prevents AR activation by binding selectively to the N-terminal domain (""NTD"") of the AR. A functional NTD is essential for activation of the AR. Blocking the NTD prevents activation of the AR by all of the three known mechanisms of activation. In pre-clinical studies, blocking the NTD has demonstrated the capability to overcome the known AR-dependent mechanisms of CRPC. ESSA was founded in 2009 and is located in Vancouver, British Columbia and Houston Texas.

About Prostate Cancer

Prostate cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and the fifth most common cause of male cancer death worldwide (Globocan, 2012). Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is dependent on androgen for tumor progression and depleting or blocking androgen action has been a mainstay of hormonal treatment for over six decades. Although tumors are often initially sensitive to medical or surgical therapies that decrease levels of testosterone (for example, ADT), disease progression despite castrate levels of testosterone generally represents a transition to the lethal variant of the disease (mCRPC) and most patients ultimately succumb to the illness. The treatment of mCRPC patients has evolved rapidly over the past five years; despite these advances, additional treatment options are needed to improve clinical outcomes in patients, particularly those who fail existing treatments including abiraterone or enzalutamide, or those that have contraindications to receive those drugs. Over time, patients with mCRPC generally experience continued disease progression, worsening pain, leading to substantial morbidity and limited survival rates. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, ESSA's novel approach to blocking the androgen pathway has been shown to be effective in blocking tumor growth when current therapies are no longer effective.

Regulatory News:

EOS imaging (Paris:EOSI) (Euronext, FR0011191766 -- EOSI), the pioneer in 2D/3D orthopedic medical imaging, announced today its commercial and organizational expansion to support the momentum of installations in adult and pediatric hospitals in the United States.

EOS imaging's technical support team, reinforced and led by a newly appointed manager, will focus on supporting the existing 47 EOS(R) systems in the US market as well as the upcoming and 2016 new installations.

The six last installations bring the US installed base to 47, with 7 additional platforms shipped and pending installation.

Centers that focus exclusively on pediatrics make up 60% of the current installed base and include 9 of the top 10 pediatric hospitals. The remaining 40% are in hospitals focusing on the adult population including 4 of the top 10 hospitals for adult orthopedics. EOS(R) systems are installed in hospitals of all sizes including those with 300 beds or less which currently represent 35% of the EOS(R) installations. There is also momentum to acquire additional systems, as was the case at 6 US hospitals already, to broaden EOS(R) usage and turn it into internal orthopedic imaging standards across all departments and sites.

Marie Meynadier, CEO of EOS imaging said, ""The record number of installations was made possible thanks to the organizational investments we have made to support the strong momentum in the United States. The extreme reduction of irradiation with the EOS(R) Micro Dose option is a must have in pediatric orthopedic imaging. The dose reduction and the launch of EOSapps for examination and surgical planning also reinforce EOS(R) as a standard of care for adult orthopedic imaging. We look forward to rapidly growing our customer base and increasing the sites with multiple systems as the value of our solution is recognized.""

The EOS(R) platform provides 2D and 3D full-body, stereo-radiographic images of patients in functional positions. EOS exams require a radiation dose 50% to 85% less than Digital Radiology and 95% less than basic CT scans. The new EOS(R) Micro Dose system, recently cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, marks another important step towards the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Available). This latest technology has made the dose for a pediatric spine follow-up exam equivalent to a week of natural background radiation on Earth.

PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 09, 2015-- 

Regulatory News:

EOS imaging (Paris:EOSI) (Euronext, FR0011191766 -- EOSI), the pioneer in 2D/3D orthopedic medical imaging, announced today its commercial and organizational expansion to support the momentum of installations in adult and pediatric hospitals in the United States.

EOS imaging's technical support team, reinforced and led by a newly appointed manager, will focus on supporting the existing 47 EOS(R) systems in the US market as well as the upcoming and 2016 new installations.

The six last installations bring the US installed base to 47, with 7 additional platforms shipped and pending installation.

Centers that focus exclusively on pediatrics make up 60% of the current installed base and include 9 of the top 10 pediatric hospitals. The remaining 40% are in hospitals focusing on the adult population including 4 of the top 10 hospitals for adult orthopedics. EOS(R) systems are installed in hospitals of all sizes including those with 300 beds or less which currently represent 35% of the EOS(R) installations. There is also momentum to acquire additional systems, as was the case at 6 US hospitals already, to broaden EOS(R) usage and turn it into internal orthopedic imaging standards across all departments and sites.

Marie Meynadier, CEO of EOS imaging said, ""The record number of installations was made possible thanks to the organizational investments we have made to support the strong momentum in the United States. The extreme reduction of irradiation with the EOS(R) Micro Dose option is a must have in pediatric orthopedic imaging. The dose reduction and the launch of EOSapps for examination and surgical planning also reinforce EOS(R) as a standard of care for adult orthopedic imaging. We look forward to rapidly growing our customer base and increasing the sites with multiple systems as the value of our solution is recognized.""

The EOS(R) platform provides 2D and 3D full-body, stereo-radiographic images of patients in functional positions. EOS exams require a radiation dose 50% to 85% less than Digital Radiology and 95% less than basic CT scans. The new EOS(R) Micro Dose system, recently cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, marks another important step towards the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Available). This latest technology has made the dose for a pediatric spine follow-up exam equivalent to a week of natural background radiation on Earth.

EOS imaging has been chosen to be included in the new EnterNext(c) PEA-PME 150 index, composed of 150 French companies and listed on Euronext and Alternext markets in Paris.

DAA-based regimens have dramatically improved HCV cure rates compared to interferon-based treatment regimens, which have been standard of care for over two decades.

Although DAA treatment is highly successful, DAA treatment can fail if a patient is infected with certain HCV variants that are drug resistant. LabCorp's HCV drug resistance assays provide clinicians with actionable knowledge that can guide treatment decisions. The HCV NS5B Drug Resistance Assay assesses resistance to sofosbuvir, which was approved as a single DAA in 2013 and as a co-formulation with the NS5A inhibitor, ledipasvir, in 2014. The HCV NS5A Drug Resistance Assay assesses resistance to ledipasvir. In addition, LabCorp's portfolio of HCV resistance assays can assess resistance to each component of the latest FDA-approved DAA-based regimen, which is comprised of paritaprevir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir.

LabCorp's HCV DAA resistance assays are the first to be developed using state of the art next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which features improved discrimination of small populations of drug resistant virus. The complete portfolio of LabCorp HCV drug resistance assays is also available through Monogram and for customers of Covance Drug Development to support pre-clinical development and clinical evaluation of new HCV DAA candidates.

Their physicochemical properties and permeation through an artificial membrane indicated good to moderate intestinal absorption. Their metabolic stabilities ranged from low to high. Despite satisfactory in vitro results and in silico predictions, only one compound resulted in a statistically significant worm burden reduction (66%) after administration of a single oral dose of 400 mg/kg of body weight to S. mansoni-infected mice.

More particularly, the present invention relates to an ophthalmic lens system that may depend on the secondary electronic external device to reduce power, communication, and processing requirements within the ophthalmic lenses.

""Traditionally, an ophthalmic device, such as a contact lens, an intraocular lens, or a punctal plug included a biocompatible device with a corrective, cosmetic, or therapeutic quality. A contact lens, for example, may provide one or more of vision correcting functionality, cosmetic enhancement, and/or therapeutic effects. Each function may be provided by a physical characteristic of the lens. A design incorporating a refractive quality into a lens may provide a vision corrective function. Pigmentation incorporated into the lens may provide a cosmetic enhancement. An active agent incorporated into a lens may provide a therapeutic functionality. Such physical characteristics may be accomplished without the lens entering into an energized state.

""More recently, active components have been included in a contact lens, and the inclusion may involve the incorporation of energizing elements within the ophthalmic device. The relatively complicated components to accomplish this effect may derive improved characteristics by including them in insert devices which are then included with standard or similar materials useful in the fabrication of state of the art ophthalmic lenses.

""The ability for a user's ophthalmic lenses to communicate with each other may expand the possible functionalities of an energizable ophthalmic lens system. Wireless communication may allow one lens to recognize the relative position of the opposite lens, which may provide a more accurate determination of where the user may be looking. Wireless communication may also allow the two lenses to interact with each other, for example, to trigger specific, different actions when a user blinks or winks.

""Communication between two contact lenses on a user may be difficult for several reasons. Each contact lens has limited area and volume for batteries and electronic components. For example, the volume available for batteries and electronic circuits in a contact lens may be less than 20 mm.sup.3, whereas the volume available for all components in a smartphone may be 50,000 mm.sup.3. Likewise, contact lens batteries may have 100 .mu.A-Hr of capacity whereas a smartphone may have a capacity of 1400 mA-Hr. Thus, each contact lens may be limited in transmitter output power and receiver sensitivity.

""Lower distance may be typically associated with reduced transmitter and receiver power requirements. Although the contact lenses may only be about 70 mm apart when on a user's eyes, there may not be a direct line of sight between the lenses, so direct light-based communication may not be possible without relying on reflections from nearby objects.

""Further, in the event a radio frequency (RF) system may be used, the antenna area available in a contact lens, along with the dielectric properties of the eye and body, may make communication inefficient. Complex processing of signals, decision inputs, and data may also be difficult in contact lenses. The aforementioned limits on area, volume, and battery capacity may constrain the size, speed, computational complexity, and current consumption of a processor. For example, while it may be preferred for application enablement to include a powerful microcontroller or central processing unit (CPU) in contact lenses, state-of-the-art technology may not allow such integration.

""Some exemplary systems may detect convergence of gaze to trigger a focus change, and without an external electronic device, the two contact lenses must obtain and transmit gaze direction, determine convergence, and signal the need to change focus. This may require communication between the lenses to carry gaze direction and focus change information. Further, this system may require tight timing synchronization between the lenses. In a system tracking gaze direction instead of just convergence, the transmission and computation requirements may be even higher.

""The addition of a larger, external electronic device may permit portions of the communication and/or processing burden to be placed in the external electronic device, thereby easing the requirements on the contact lenses. Similar techniques are used in cellular communications, where a user's handset has limited battery power and limited size, and thus limited transmitter and receiver power and antenna gain. In such an example, the much larger available size and current in the cellular base station permits higher gain, power, and computational complexity.

""It may be anticipated that some of the solutions for increasing wireless communication between energizable ophthalmic lenses may provide novel aspects for non-energized devices and other biomedical devices. Accordingly, there may be a need in the art for improved wireless communication between lenses, and utilizing a secondary external device may offer a solution to many of the current issues with inter-lens communication.""

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, VerticalNews editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent application: ""The addition of an external electronic device, such as a smartphone, watch, or tablet, may ease the communication requirements for an ophthalmic lens system. As described below, such a device may have much higher battery power and communication capability. Thus, it may be easier for each contact lens to communicate with a common, external device than with each other. Because of the greater area, volume, and battery capacity available in an external electronic device, the electrical requirements of the contact lens may be eased.

""For example, a high-sensitivity receiver may be employed in an electronic device thereby reducing the output power requirements in a contact lens transmitter. Such a high-sensitivity receiver in the electronic device may include a low-noise amplifier (LNA), intermediate gain stages, high-dynamic-range and high-resolution analog-to-digital converter, and complex digital signal processing. In some exemplary embodiments, rather than integrating complex signal processing and microcontroller functionality into contact lenses, these functions may be performed in the external electronic device.

""Such applications may even be performed in existing components of the electronic device, for example, the applications processor or CPU of the electronic device. The external device may comprise more complex and sensitive transceiver circuitry, for example, transmitter and receiver gain and signal processing.

""In some applications, the functionality of the contact lenses may depend on communication with each other with or without an external device, for example, where the contact lenses comprise a variable optic portion, which may allow for adjustable powers. Other exemplary embodiments may specifically involve an electronic device, for example, one where the contact lenses may be used to control the external device. In such examples, the external device may be used to ease the requirements on the contact lenses. Accordingly, there may be a need in the art for improved wireless communication between lenses, and utilizing a secondary external device may offer a solution to many of the current issues with inter-lens communication.

""Accordingly, the present invention comprises an ophthalmic lens system capable of wireless communication through the utilization of an external device, wherein the ophthalmic lens system comprises a first ophthalmic lens on a first eye and a second ophthalmic lens on a second eye, wherein the lenses may be configured to wirelessly communicate with each other by transmitting and receiving data through an external device.

IMBRUVICA was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for WM by the FDA and is being jointly developed and commercialized by Janssen and Pharmacyclics, Inc.

The update to the IMBRUVICA label is based on data from a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Phase 2 study. Earlier releases of these data were previously presented at the 2013 American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the 2013 International Congress of Malignant Lymphoma (ICML) annual meetings.

'Since the first description of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia more than 70 years ago, there has been no approved treatment for this cancer. Rather, doctors relied on therapies borrowed from similar cancers to treat these patients. I am truly grateful to the FDA for their thorough review and expedited approval of IMBRUVICA for this indication. The approval was made possible because of the hard work and dedication of scientists and clinicians at various leading medical centers who diligently worked on the clinical trial that supports IMBRUVICA as a safe and effective therapy for patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,' said Steven P. Treon, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School, and, who led the trial.

'Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia patients and physicians have been waiting for a treatment specifically studied and approved to treat this rare disease,' said Carl Harrington, President of the International Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia Foundation. 'The approval of IMBRUVICA is an important milestone for the entire global WM community and has the potential to positively impact our patients, their physicians and caregivers.'

The Phase 2 multi-center study on which this approval was based evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of IMBRUVICA 420 mg once daily in 63 patients with previously treated WM (median age of 63; range, 44-86 years old). The response rate as assessed by an Independent Review Committee using criteria adopted from the International Workshop on WM was 62 percent (95% CI, 48.8, 73.9). Nearly 51 percent of patients achieved a partial response (PR) and 11 percent achieved a very good PR. No complete responses were reported. The median duration of response has not been reached (2.8+, 18.8+ months). The median time to response was 1.2 months (range, 0.7-13.4 months).

The most commonly occurring adverse reactions in the WM trial (=20 percent of IMBRUVICA patients) were neutropenia (decreased amount of neutrophils in the blood), thrombocytopenia (decrease in platelets in the blood), diarrhea, rash, nausea, muscle spasms and fatigue. Six percent of patients in the WM trial receiving IMBRUVICA discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Adverse events leading to dose reduction occurred in 11 percent of patients.

'The IMBRUVICA Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia approval is a sterling example of collaboration for the benefit of patients,' said Peter F. Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Global Oncology Head, Janssen. 'All partners involved recognized the urgent need for approved treatment options for those living with WM, and collectively set an aggressive pace to gain approval. The fact that the FDA granted full approval for this indication is meaningful and confirms the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in WM.'

In the U.S., there are approximately 1,000 to 1,500 new cases of WM each year and the median age at diagnosis is 60 to 70 years of age.2,3 WM (a clinically recognized subset of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, or LPL) begins with a malignant change to the B cell, a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte), during its maturation so that it continues to reproduce more malignant B cells.4 WM cells make large amounts of a certain type of antibody (immunoglobulin M, or IgM) mostly in the bone marrow.4 Antibodies such as IgM normally help the body to fight infection.4 However, the overproduction of IgM, a hallmark of WM, often leads to the bone marrow becoming dysfunctional.4 Typically, patients with WM are diagnosed after developing symptoms associated with the disease such as anemia, fatigue and night sweats.4

About IMBRUVICA

IMBRUVICA was one of the first therapies to receive U.S. approval after having received the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation. IMBRUVICA works by blocking a specific protein called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK).1 The BTK protein transmits important signals that tell B cells to mature and produce antibodies and is needed by specific cancer cells to multiply and spread.1, IMBRUVICA targets and blocks BTK, inhibiting cancer cell survival and spread.1 For more information, visit www.IMBRUVICA.com.

Janssen and Pharmacyclics are striving to make the process of obtaining IMBRUVICA and navigating insurance benefits easy for patients. The YOU&i Support Program is a personalized program that includes information on access and affordability, nurse call support and resources for patients being treated with IMBRUVICA. This includes the YOU&i Instant Savings program, which provides co-pay support and benefits information to eligible commercially-insured patients.

Additional Information about IMBRUVICA

INDICATIONS

IMBRUVICA is indicated to treat people with:

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy

Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p deletion

Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM)

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hemorrhage - Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events (subdural hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and post-procedural hemorrhage) have occurred in up to 6% of patients. Bleeding events of any grade, including bruising and petechiae, occurred in approximately half of patients treated with IMBRUVICA.

The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. IMBRUVICA may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.

Infections - Fatal and non-fatal infections have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 14% to 26% of patients. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor patients for fever and infections and evaluate promptly.

Cytopenias - Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias including neutropenia (range, 19 to 29%), thrombocytopenia (range, 5 to 17%), and anemia (range, 0 to 9%) occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor complete blood counts monthly.

Atrial Fibrillation - Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (range, 6 to 9%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors, acute infections, and a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically monitor patients clinically for atrial fibrillation. Patients who develop arrhythmic symptoms (eg, palpitations, lightheadedness) or new-onset dyspnea should have an ECG performed. If atrial fibrillation persists, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA treatment and dose modification.

Second Primary Malignancies - Other malignancies (range, 5 to 14%) including non-skin carcinomas (range, 1 to 3%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (range, 4 to 11%).

Tumor Lysis Syndrome - Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with IMBRUVICA therapy. Monitor patients closely and take appropriate precautions in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (e.g. high tumor burden).

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity - Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions (=25%) in patients with B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL, WM) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, bruising, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, and rash. Seven percent of patients receiving IMBRUVICA discontinued treatment due to adverse events.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

CYP3A Inhibitors - Avoid co-administration with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, reduce the IMBRUVICA dose.

CYP3A Inducers - Avoid co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers.

SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Hepatic Impairment - Avoid use in patients with moderate or severe baseline hepatic impairment. In patients with mild impairment, reduce IMBRUVICA dose.

The action may help ensure that more healthcare providers and patients with a suspected PS or ET across the United States will have access to imaging with this agent.

DaTscan is a radioactive drug that is injected into the bloodstream to help image areas of the brain using an imaging technique called ‘SPECT’ (single-photon emission computed tomography). For an adult with a suspected PS, a doctor may decide to conduct SPECT imaging with DaTscan, along with other medical tests, to help decide if movement difficulties are due to a PS or a similar condition known as ET. Types of PS include PD, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. DaTscan was not designed to differentiate among different forms of PS. The effectiveness of DaTscan as a screening or confirmatory test and for monitoring disease progression or response to therapy has not been established. Movement disorders are primarily diagnosed through clinical examinations. However, clinical exams alone, particularly early in the disease, may be inconclusive and can result in misdiagnosis. The most common side effects of DaTscan are headache, upset stomach, a sensation of motion, dry mouth, and dizziness.

‘We fully support the DEA’s decision to remove ioflupane I 123, the active ingredient in DaTscan, from the Schedules of the Controlled Substances Act,’ said Etienne Montagut, global product leader of neurology and cardiology for GE Healthcare. ‘Because of the DEA’s decision, this important imaging tool will be more widely available to the medical community. Increasing the availability of DaTscan helps us fulfill our commitment to provide innovative, high-quality, and affordable healthcare solutions to patients who need them most.’

‘The Parkinson’s Action Network (PAN) applauds the DEA for descheduling the active ingredient in DaTscan and allowing many more people to have access to this important diagnostic tool,’ said Ted Thompson, JD, chief executive officer of PAN. ‘Having this tool available for people with suspected parkinsonian syndromes and essential tremor may help them to receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment sooner.’

Since the approval of DaTscan in 2011, it has been listed by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance. This has restricted its use to only those healthcare professionals and imaging facilities registered with the DEA and able to comply with all of the requirements for the appropriate prescribing, storage, use, and disposal of Schedule II controlled substances. Descheduling has removed these roadblocks, making it easier for imaging specialists to initiate and order DaTscan, as well as to compliantly administer it in their facilities.

GE Healthcare would like to thank the DEA, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the movement disorder community for their collaborative efforts to achieve this important milestone for Parkinson’s patients.

Increasing the availability of DaTscan helps us fulfill our commitment to provide innovative, high-quality, and affordable healthcare solutions to patients who need them most.’

‘The Parkinson’s Action Network (PAN) applauds the DEA for descheduling the active ingredient in DaTscan and allowing many more people to have access to this important diagnostic tool,’ said Ted Thompson, JD, chief executive officer of PAN. ‘Having this tool available for people with suspected parkinsonian syndromes and essential tremor may help them to receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment sooner.’

Since the approval of DaTscan in 2011, it has been listed by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance. This has restricted its use to only those healthcare professionals and imaging facilities registered with the DEA and able to comply with all of the requirements for the appropriate prescribing, storage, use, and disposal of Schedule II controlled substances. Descheduling has removed these roadblocks, making it easier for imaging specialists to initiate and order DaTscan, as well as to compliantly administer it in their facilities.

GE Healthcare would like to thank the DEA, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the movement disorder community for their collaborative efforts to achieve this important milestone for Parkinson’s patients.

The action may help ensure that more healthcare providers and patients with a suspected PS or ET across the United States will have access to imaging with this agent.

DaTscan is a radioactive drug that is injected into the bloodstream to help image areas of the brain using an imaging technique called ‘SPECT’ (single-photon emission computed tomography). For an adult with a suspected PS, a doctor may decide to conduct SPECT imaging with DaTscan, along with other medical tests, to help decide if movement difficulties are due to a PS or a similar condition known as ET. Types of PS include PD, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. DaTscan was not designed to differentiate among different forms of PS. The effectiveness of DaTscan as a screening or confirmatory test and for monitoring disease progression or response to therapy has not been established. Movement disorders are primarily diagnosed through clinical examinations. However, clinical exams alone, particularly early in the disease, may be inconclusive and can result in misdiagnosis.

Prices have to cover the costs. Get over it, or go find a naturopath.

That is only partly bullshit. Dealing with the chemistry of tomorrow and the regulatory hurdles of today is expensive. Yet in some European countries, the same name-brand prescription meds cost about half what they do in the US, according to a 2008 McKinsey study.

How then might we come up with a reasonable way to tether prices without quashing the incentive to innovate? Well, it's complicated. Patent law, gobs of health care legislation, insurance, taxes, lobbyists, ethics—prescription drug costs touch all of them and more. But there are steps we can take to reel prices in. First is shifting away from monopolistic pricing to a more competitive model. Second is designing mechanisms that link the cost of drugs to the value delivered to patients, insurers, society, and even science. The time to move on this issue is now, while the spectacle of a young man named Martin Shkreli is still fresh in mind.

Yeah, that guy. Earlier this year, Shkreli's company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, increased the price of a recently acquired drug from $13.50 to $750 a pill. The medicine, Daraprim, is used to combat parasites, especially for patients with immune-system deficiencies like HIV.

Within a day, Shkreli was being lambasted on every platform and outlet imaginable. His brashness and previous job as a hedge fund manager only made the bull's-eye bigger. “He even looks like a prick,” a fellow parent said to me on his way into a PTA meeting in late September.

Yet Shkreli wasn't breaking any laws. As physician Peter Bach, director of the Health Policy and Outcomes program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, put it, the Shkreli dustup shows that the system is “so broken even a child could manipulate it.”

Bach made headlines in 2012 when he and his colleagues refused to offer patients a new drug because they didn't see sufficient health benefit to justify the $11,000 monthly cost. Weeks later the drugmaker cut the price by 50 percent. It was a rare victory that, like the Shkreli episode, illustrates just how fragile the market for drugs really is. (When Hillary Clinton jumped into the fray with a tweet declaring her intention to do something about drug pricing, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index dropped 5.1 percent.) “Investors know,” Bach says. They know that if and when real scrutiny happens, pricing will be revealed for what it is: indefensible.

In a typical marketplace, forces like competition and regulation help keep prices down. You and me? We don't care what it costs to make a saucepan. If the product provides us with value, we'll pay for it. If we can get the same value out of a different saucepan that's half as expensive, we'll buy that one.

The marketplace for medicines in the US is nothing like that. Instead of thinking of drug companies as free-enterprise actors, we should think of them as “fragile little birds that the protective hand of government carefully shields from the harsh vagaries of truly free, competitive markets,” writes Uwe Reinhardt, professor of economics at Princeton. That protection comes in the form of patents and market exclusivity, plus laws against reselling drugs. Rising drug prices across the industry force insurance companies' costs to ratchet up too, despite their best efforts to negotiate better deals. Meanwhile, Medicare, which should have huge bargaining power, isn't permitted to negotiate with manufacturers.

IN EUROPE, REGULATORS REFUSE TO APPROVE DRUGS THAT HAVE A POOR COST-BENEFIT RATIO.

Many European countries have taken a different approach, creating a more robust competitive environment. (Yes, Europe!) If you roll out a new medicine there, regulators will examine how effective it is compared to status quo treatments and set the price accordingly. And they refuse to approve new drugs that have a poor cost-benefit ratio. The specter of refusal alone puts downward pressure on prices.

In the US, an analogous strategy for dealing with drug pricing would be to establish some kind of connection between a drug's price and the value it confers. This past summer, Bach and colleagues at Sloan Kettering introduced an online calculator called DrugAbacus, which compares present-day costs for dozens of cancer drugs with theoretical prices determined by adjustable variables like side effects, R&D costs, predicted years of life added, and the number of people each drug could help. (Other organizations, including the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, also have a system for calculating value-based pricing.) “This is about finding the right prices,” Bach says. “If prices are reasonable, people will be OK to pay them.”

It's a start anyway. “I don't know if I'm missing some of the domains,” Bach says. “This is going from ‘I'd like to price based on values but don't know how’ to having some kind of attempt to do so.” At a minimum, DrugAbacus and other cost-assessment tools put more information into the marketplace, which is healthy.

In the meantime, don't let up on the Shkrelis of the world. Remember what happened after the avalanche of outrage? He backtracked (some). According to a 2006 paper in the Rand Journal of Economics, drug costs are influenced by the mere presence of public debate.

Who knows? Perhaps citizens of the near future will ultimately owe Martin Shkreli a debt of gratitude for inadvertently fast-tracking change to a system that once looked immovable.

After looking at more than 12,400 cases, they concluded that the newer and more expensive drug provided no significant improvement in health outcomes. The study was controversial and, not surprisingly, contested by Genentech, the company behind the costlier option. It also kick-started a conversation about the rising cost of medicines. The price tag of the new drug in the study was $2,200 per dose, after all.

How quaint. Today, many drugs cost more than $30,000 a pop.

""This builds upon Merck's three-decade long commitment to both innovation and access to address the global HIV epidemic.""

Raltegravir is the only integrase inhibitor approved for use in infants and children as young as four weeks in the United States and European Union. Pediatric formulations of raltegravir are available as chewable tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) and granules for oral suspension (single-use 100 mg packets).

Merck is providing the MPP a royalty-free license for the development of pediatric formulations of raltegravir-chewable tablets and granules for oral suspension-for infants and children from four weeks to under 12 years of age. The agreement is designed to improve access to raltegravir for pediatric populations in low- and middle-income countries with significantly high rates of pediatric HIV, totaling 92 countries. In addition to providing expanded access, the agreement allows for development of new pediatric formulations of raltegravir, in support of the ""Global Pediatric Antiretroviral Commitment-to-Action"" announced by the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Pediatric HIV Treatment Initiative (PHTI), and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to accelerate the development of new, high-priority pediatric antiretroviral co-formulations.

""MPP is pleased to have Merck on board as a new private sector partner working with us on pediatric programs,"" said Greg Perry, executive director, MPP. ""Raltegravir adds to our arsenal of pediatric licenses in supporting better options for children in low- and middle-income countries and can benefit the most neglected sub-segment: infants and toddlers less than three years of age.""

Despite efforts to eliminate pediatric HIV, it is estimated that there are 3.2 million children infected with HIV worldwide and almost 800 die every day because of lack of access to treatment and care. In fact, it is estimated that less than a quarter of all children infected with HIV worldwide are receiving antiretrovirals. Therefore, it is critical to develop innovative formulations to meet this unmet medical need while ensuring access to these therapies. As such, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines have listed raltegravir as an important product needed for certain pediatric populations.

For 30 years, Merck has demonstrated its commitment to improved access to HIV medicines through longstanding efforts including differential pricing, voluntary licensing, public-private partnerships, philanthropic programs, and continued research and development efforts in HIV. For more information about Merck's corporate responsibility in HIV, visit www.merckresponsibility.com/access-to-health/infectious-diseases/hiv-aids/. Selected Safety Information Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS (raltegravir) and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develops and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely.

Immune reconstitution syndrome can occur, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.

ISENTRESS (raltegravir) chewable tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame, which may be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria.

Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that are strong inducers of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir. Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir.

Coadministration of ISENTRESS and other drugs may alter the plasma concentration of raltegravir. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. Coadministration or staggered administration of aluminum and/or magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids and ISENTRESS is not recommended.

Rifampin, a strong inducer of UGT1A1, reduces plasma concentrations of ISENTRESS. Therefore, the dose of ISENTRESS for adults should be increased to 800 mg twice daily during coadministration with rifampin. There are no data to guide coadministration of ISENTRESS with rifampin in patients below 18 years of age.

The most commonly reported (=2%) drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity in treatment-naive adult patients receiving ISENTRESS compared with efavirenz were insomnia (4% vs 4%), headache (4% vs 5%), nausea (3% vs 4%), fatigue (2% vs 3%), and dizziness (2% vs 6%) respectively. In treatment-experienced adult patients receiving ISENTRESS, the most commonly reported (=2%) drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity and at a higher incidence compared with placebo was headache (2% vs <1%). In both studies, intensities were defined as: Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); or Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity). In treatment-experienced pediatric patients 4 weeks through 18 years of age receiving ISENTRESS, the frequency, type and severity of drug-related adverse reactions were comparable to those observed in adults.

Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase.

Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing ISENTRESS + darunavir/ritonavir compared to subjects receiving ISENTRESS without darunavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir without ISENTRESS. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all 3 groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash.

ISENTRESS (raltegravir) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. In addition, there have been no pharmacokinetic studies conducted in pregnant patients.

Sixty-one patients with active RA despite methotrexate treatment, and with MRI-documented synovitis, were randomized to receive infliximab or placebo. Blood was collected at baseline and genome-wide transcription in whole blood was measured using microarrays. The primary endpoint in this study was determined by measuring the transfer rate constant (Ktrans) of a gadolinium-based contrast agent from plasma to synovium using MRI. Secondary endpoints included repeated clinical assessments with DAS28(CRP), and assessments of osteitis and synovitis by the RAMRIS method. Infliximab showed greater decrease from baseline in DCE-MRI Ktrans of wrist and MCP at all visits compared with placebo (p <0.001). Statistical analysis was performed to identify genes associated with treatment-specific 14-week change in Ktrans. The 256 genes identified were used to derive a gene signature score by averaging their log expression within each patient. The resulting score correlated with improvement of Ktrans in infliximab-treated patients and with deterioration of Ktrans in placebo-treated subjects. Poor responders showed high expression of activated B-cell genes whereas good responders exhibited a gene expression pattern consistent with mobilization of neutrophils and monocytes and high levels of reticulated platelets. This gene signature was significantly associated with clinical response in two previously published whole blood gene expression studies using anti-TNF therapies.

These drugs are already approved for other uses. Naltrexone is used to help kick alcohol and narcotic addiction. Bupropion is used to treat depression and seasonal affective disorder. Many people also take bupropion to stop smoking. Neither naltrexone nor bupropion by itself has been approved for weight loss.

Why should the combination of these drugs help with weight loss? It's likely that the drugs act on impulse, reward and/or hunger centers in the brain to decrease appetite and dampen the reflex to seek food for comfort.

Not everyone who is overweight needs a weight loss drug. Contrave is approved for adults who are obese and for certain people who are overweight. Obese is defined as a body mass index, or BMI, of 30 or higher. Overweight adults have a BMI between 25 and 30. Overweight adults should only take Contrave if they also have at least one other weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure or Type 2 diabetes. If you don't know your BMI, you can look it up on the BMI table I've put on my website, AskDoctorK.com.

The FDA approved Contrave based on the results of several clinical trials that included 4,500 overweight and obese men and women. All were treated for one year.

In one trial of people without diabetes, 42 percent of those who took Contrave lost at least 5 percent of their body weight, compared with 17 percent of those who took a placebo. In a trial of people with diabetes, 36 percent of those taking Contrave lost at least 5 percent of their body weight, compared with 18 percent of those taking a placebo.

Like any drug, Contrave can cause unwanted, sometimes serious, side effects. Used alone, bupropion has been linked to suicidal thoughts, as well as seizures. And naltrexone use has been linked to seizures. I think the drug should be avoided by anyone who:

I am reluctant to get enthusiastic about a new medicine until some time has passed. The 4,500 people who participated in studies is a pretty large number.

Gold, M.D., Ph.D., chief of cardiology, Michael E Assey Professor of Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina, and principal investigator in the Evera MRI Clinical Trial. ""Many of these patients also need access to MRIs, so the approval of an ICD that can be used in an MRI environment is crucial, and can help provide patients with the peace of mind that they are receiving the best care available.""

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a sudden, abrupt loss of heart function that can result in death if not treated within minutes with an electrical cardioverter shock, which can be delivered by an ICD. MRI is considered the gold standard in soft-tissue imaging and is used regularly for the diagnosis of conditions such as stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and muscle, bone and joint pain.

Until now, patients with ICD systems have been contraindicated by the FDA from receiving MRI scans because of potential interactions between the MRI and device function, which might result in risk to patients. These MRI restrictions have resulted in a critical unmet need as data have shown that, within four years, more than one-third of patients with ICDs - 36 percent - are likely to need an MRI.1

The Evera MRI ICD system includes hardware and software design enhancements from previous generation devices that allow it to safely undergo full-body MRIs, while maintaining the same longevity, proven shock reduction and physiological size and shape of the original Evera ICD. The device is paired with the Sprint Quattro® Secure MRI SureScan® DF4 leads, part of the only ICD lead family with more than 10 years of proven performance with active monitoring,2 now tested for safe use in an MRI environment.

The FDA approval of the Evera MRI ICD system was based on safety and efficacy data from the Evera MRI Clinical Trial, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial that enrolled 275 patients at 42 centers around the world. Presented during a late-breaking clinical trial session at Heart Rhythm 2015, the Heart Rhythm Society's 36th Annual Scientific Sessions, and published simultaneously in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), these data demonstrated that the Evera MRI ICD system is safe and effective, and that full-body MRI scans did not affect its ability to deliver life-saving therapy.3

""The Evera MRI ICD system underwent comprehensive computer modeling of more than 2.3 million clinical scenarios and this information, combined with the safety data from the clinical trial, has resulted in this critical regulatory approval,"" said Marshall Stanton, M.D., vice president and general manager of the Tachycardia business, which is part of the Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division at Medtronic. ""As pioneers in the development of implantable cardiac devices that can be used in an MRI environment, Medtronic is committed to ongoing innovation to address the clinical needs of physicians and patients.""

DUBLIN - Sept. 14, 2015 - Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) today announced that it has received the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The Medtronic Evera MRI(TM) SureScan® ICD System is approved for MRI scans on any part of the body without positioning restrictions, which means that patients in the U.S. who depend on life-saving ICDs also now have access to MRI scans if and when they need them. The newly approved system, which will be commercially available this month, includes the Evera MRI ICD and Sprint Quattro® Secure MRI SureScan® DF4 leads, which must be used together to be considered MR-conditional.",HUGNEN,Nasdaq / Globenewswire,True,"['cappro', 'grdly', 'gcard', 'npress', 'c13', 'c22', 'ccat', 'gcat', 'ghea', 'gmed', 'gtrea', 'ncat', 'nfact', 'nfcpin']",Medtronic First to Receive FDA Approval for MR-Conditional Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator System,"Medtronic First to Receive FDA Approval for MR-Conditional Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator System""Patients at risk for sudden cardiac arrest have long relied on ICDs to monitor their hearts, detect dangerous arrhythmias and deliver the life-saving therapy needed to survive,"" said Michael R. Gold, M.D., Ph.D., chief of cardiology, Michael E Assey Professor of Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina, and principal investigator in the Evera MRI Clinical Trial. ""Many of these patients also need access to MRIs, so the approval of an ICD that can be used in an MRI environment is crucial, and can help provide patients with the peace of mind that they are receiving the best care available.""

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a sudden, abrupt loss of heart function that can result in death if not treated within minutes with an electrical cardioverter shock, which can be delivered by an ICD. MRI is considered the gold standard in soft-tissue imaging and is used regularly for the diagnosis of conditions such as stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and muscle, bone and joint pain.

Until now, patients with ICD systems have been contraindicated by the FDA from receiving MRI scans because of potential interactions between the MRI and device function, which might result in risk to patients. These MRI restrictions have resulted in a critical unmet need as data have shown that, within four years, more than one-third of patients with ICDs - 36 percent - are likely to need an MRI.1

The Evera MRI ICD system includes hardware and software design enhancements from previous generation devices that allow it to safely undergo full-body MRIs, while maintaining the same longevity, proven shock reduction and physiological size and shape of the original Evera ICD. The device is paired with the Sprint Quattro® Secure MRI SureScan® DF4 leads, part of the only ICD lead family with more than 10 years of proven performance with active monitoring,2 now tested for safe use in an MRI environment.

The FDA approval of the Evera MRI ICD system was based on safety and efficacy data from the Evera MRI Clinical Trial, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial that enrolled 275 patients at 42 centers around the world. Presented during a late-breaking clinical trial session at Heart Rhythm 2015, the Heart Rhythm Society's 36th Annual Scientific Sessions, and published simultaneously in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), these data demonstrated that the Evera MRI ICD system is safe and effective, and that full-body MRI scans did not affect its ability to deliver life-saving therapy.3

""The Evera MRI ICD system underwent comprehensive computer modeling of more than 2.3 million clinical scenarios and this information, combined with the safety data from the clinical trial, has resulted in this critical regulatory approval,"" said Marshall Stanton, M.D., vice president and general manager of the Tachycardia business, which is part of the Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division at Medtronic.

Regulatory incentives should create ""a regulatory and medical landscape which adapts to these new realities,"" he said.

In addition to regulatory incentives, he said there needs to be federal funding set aside to specifically encourage research into infectious disease diagnostics and there needs to be creative and adaptive modernized clinical trial models.

There also needs to be a change in reimbursement policies ""based on medical value and the importance of the diagnostic test to manage patients, and not just on the technology,"" Miller said. As an example, Miller said a host-based signature assay for diagnosing strep throat should not be reimbursed the same as a protein signature assay for diagnosing tuberculosis reinfection or sepsis.

Without this reimbursement differential, he said, in vitro diagnostic manufacturers will be reluctant to invest the money necessary to develop ""the innovative and necessary biomarkers that we need today.""

The White House action plan calls for FDA and CMS to work with industry partners to streamline development and uptake of new diagnostic tests and facilitate their use to improve patient treatment and achieve public health goals. ""A major aim of these efforts is to develop well-defined reimbursement policies and incentives that encourage routine use of diagnostics in clinical settings to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections and identify the antibiotic susceptibilities of bacteria,"" the plan states.

FDA says in a discussion paper prepared for the public meeting that progress in the development and validation of non-microbial analytes for diagnosing infections has been hampered by uncertainty regarding clinically relevant performance standards as well as the diversity of approaches to clinical study design, comparator methods and statistical analysis.

""Increased emphasis on antibiotic stewardship has heightened interest in non-microbial based biomarkers in settings where infection may be suspected but difficult or problematic to confirm,"" the discussion paper says. ""Differentiating disease etiology by non-microbial analytes is not a new concept; analytes such as procalcitonin (PCT) and CRP have strong advocates and detractors for use in patients with suspected or documented infection.""

The public meeting, in part, focused on the use of non-microbial biomarkers to discriminate between viral, bacterial and non-infectious etiologies of suspected respiratory infection, because the agency said this has been a major focus of non-microbial biomarker research.

""There has been greater impetus for this research in the setting of rising antimicrobial resistance and increasing recognition of potential adverse effects from antimicrobials,"" FDA says.

The agency says that the scientific community generally conducts studies for these types of diagnostics using prospective trials. This is challenging because uncommon but clinically significant pathogens may be difficult to capture -- even in large clinical trials -- using a prospective approach, FDA adds.

FDA also is exploring non-microbial biomarkers for the diagnosis of sepsis, which the agency notes is not a singular disease entity with a clearly defined pathophysiology relative to a non-septic state. -- Erin Durkin ","['biomer', 'biomer', 'biomer', 'usfda', 'usfda']",['biomer'],Inside Washington Publishers,",usa,namz,",NAMZ USA ,"An industry stakeholder told FDA the regulatory landscape must be revamped to help in vitro diagnostic companies develop non-microbial biomarkers for infection, raising the issue at a public meeting on the issue last Friday (Oct. 16).

The New Jersey-based drug maker filed its lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York -- the same jurisdiction that is currently working through an off-label promotion case brought against FDA by Amarin Pharma Inc. In the Amarin case, Circuit Court Judge Paul Engelmayer granted Amarin a wide-ranging preliminary injunction to promote its drug Vascepa off-label based on a 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals 2012 decision in United States v. Caronia.

A scheduling order for the case posted last week says FDA and Pacira ""have engaged in and continue to engage in settlement discussions in hopes of resolving this case or, at a minimum, narrowing the dispute,"" and gives the agency until Nov. 12 to respond to the lawsuit.

An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on the agency removing the letter from its website, saying ""it relates to matters involving pending/ongoing legislation.""

Foley & Lardner attorney David Rosen says it is rare for FDA to pull a warning letter.

""I've been working in the FDA world for about 36 years, and it doesn't happen often -- it's pretty rare,"" Rosen said. ""Pulling the warning letter doesn't mean it's rescinded, there must have been discussions with the company.""

The warning letter was the basis for Pacira filing the lawsuit.

In October 2011, FDA approved Exparel for ""administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia,"" which the drug maker contends is a broad indication. Pacira notes that in the approved labeling there are no limits on the use in any type of surgical procedure, and the only limitation is on pediatric use.

FDA granted the indication based on two representative clinical studies -- one on hemorrhoidectomy patients to study the effect of the drug on soft tissue pain, and one on bunionectomy patients to study the effect on hard-tissue/orthopedic pain. Pacira points out that FDA normally has approved analgesics with broad indications and broad dosing paradigms ""based on limited clinical studies that are understood to be representative and extrapolative."" The company also says FDA approved Exparel as effective for up to 72 hours.

In October 2014, after three years of the product's marketing and during which Pacira regularly sent FDA its promotional materials for review, the agency sent the drug maker the warning letter saying administration guides by the company and a journal advertisement are misleading and misbrand the product.

In the warning letter, FDA says the administration guides promote a use for Exparel that is not approved because they describe administration techniques for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and open colectomy,noting that only dosing regimes for hemorrhoidectomy and bunionectomy are included on the label.

Rosen says it's odd for Pacira to receive a general indication and then for FDA to say the company can only market Exparel for hemorrhoidectomy and bunionectomy.

""It's not necessarily off-label per se, unless FDA is perceiving more specific indication to be specifically off-label -- but for a pain relief pain that's kind of interesting,"" Rosen said.

Pacira complied with FDA's warning letter in order to ""minimize further disruption to its business,"" but also made several attempts to meet with the agency to discuss why the warning letter was in error. This included sending FDA a 32-page white paper in June 2015 outlining why the agency's position is ""inconsistent with scientific evidence, prior precedents, and the FDA's own regulations.""

The drug maker says it has been completely rebuffed by the FDA. In July 2015, FDA sent Pacira a close-out letter on the warning letter without any ""formal or informal"" response to the drug maker's repeated attempts at rebuttal and meeting requests, the company says. Because of this, the company says, it had no other recourse but to file suit against the agency.

Pacira contends by limiting Exparel's indications in the warning letter to hemorrhoidectomy and bunionectomy the agency is changing the rules after the fact, thereby violating the Administrative Procedure Act and the company's Fifth Amendment right to due process.

Additionally, Pacira says in the complaint that even if the claims it was making were off-label -- which the company vehemently says were not -- the 2nd Circuit's ruling in Caronia that ""the government cannot prosecute pharmaceutical manufacturers and their representatives under the FDCA for speech promoting the lawful, off-label use of an FDA approved drug"" would allow the drug maker to make the claims. -- Todd Allen Wilson (twilson@iwpnews.com)","['pacphr', 'ethold', 'ethold', 'follar', 'follar', 'pacphr', 'pacphr', 'usfda', 'usfda']",['pacphr'],Inside Washington Publishers,",usa,namz,",NAMZ USA ,"Posted: October 30, 2015 FDA recently pulled from its website an off-label promotion warning letter to Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc. that was the basis of a lawsuit against the agency, as court records indicate the two are working towards a settlement in the case filed by the company in September.

This included sending FDA a 32-page white paper in June 2015 outlining why the agency's position is ""inconsistent with scientific evidence, prior precedents, and the FDA's own regulations.""

The drug maker says it has been completely rebuffed by the FDA. In July 2015, FDA sent Pacira a close-out letter on the warning letter without any ""formal or informal"" response to the drug maker's repeated attempts at rebuttal and meeting requests, the company says. Because of this, the company says, it had no other recourse but to file suit against the agency.

Pacira contends by limiting Exparel's indications in the warning letter to hemorrhoidectomy and bunionectomy the agency is changing the rules after the fact, thereby violating the Administrative Procedure Act and the company's Fifth Amendment right to due process.

Additionally, Pacira says in the complaint that even if the claims it was making were off-label -- which the company vehemently says were not -- the 2nd Circuit's ruling in Caronia that ""the government cannot prosecute pharmaceutical manufacturers and their representatives under the FDCA for speech promoting the lawful, off-label use of an FDA approved drug"" would allow the drug maker to make the claims. -- Todd Allen Wilson (twilson@iwpnews.com)",881.0

Brief Summary: During cataract surgery an artificial lens is implanted in the eye. These artificial lenses are called intraocular lenses (IOLs) and there are many different types of IOL designs. IOLs are of fixed focus and so unless a multifocal IOL is used you would need to wear spectacles for viewing near objects. This study has been designed to look at how well a multifocal IOL corrects distance and near vision in comparison with a conventional monofocal IOL. Both types of IOLs are commercially available and are commonly implanted. Using new non-invasive methods we hope to be able to better judge the visual performance of these IOLs. In addition the study will involve imaging and examining the IOLs to determine the prevalence of any post-operative complications.",INDFED,US Fed News,False,"['gblind', 'gcat', 'ghea', 'gmed']",Clinical Trial: Clinical Investigation of the Bi Flex M Multifocal IOL,"Clinical Trial: Clinical Investigation of the Bi Flex M Multifocal IOLStudy Start Date: January 2015

This had been a fear since other drugs in Januvia's class, called DPP-4 inhibitors, have been connected to cardiovascular risk. This month, the FDA added a warning to the label on Onglyza, a DPP-4 developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and marketed by AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), that it could boost the risk of heart failure and death.

""This removes MRK's biggest overhang,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a research note. ""We believe it is likely that TECOS could be used to differentiate MRK's Januvia from, at a minimum, Onglyza/Kombiglyze.""

Januvia and its sister drug Janumet contribute 14% of Merck's total sales, and their quarterly revenue of $1.39 billion was up 10% from Q1 2014, and $32 million above consensus.

The overall revenue decline was due mostly to foreign-exchange headwinds and divestitures, as the company has restructured to focus more on innovative drugs.

One such drug is Keytruda, a cancer drug in the new PD-1 inhibitor class that Merck launched for melanoma last September. Keytruda's $83 million in Q1 sales was $13 million above consensus, and also contrasted with Bristol-Myers' rival PD-1 Opdivo, whose sales of $40 million missed consensus in Bristol's Q1 report Tuesday.

""We believe the market underappreciates Merck's immuno-oncology drug Keytruda,"" Morningstar analyst Damien Conover wrote in a research note Tuesday. ""We expect the addition of the lung cancer indication later in 2015 to bring an additional $5 billion in Keytruda sales at peak.""

Merck did not change its sales guidance of $38.3 billion to $39.8 billion, but it upped its estimate of adverse foreign-exchange impact by some $200 million, indicating an ""operational"" sales increase, noted Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum. Merck guided operating EPS at $3.35 to $3.48, tightening its previous guidance and raising the high end by a penny.

Last year Merck made $3.49 a share on $42.2 billion in revenue.

Meanwhile, United Therapeutics (NASDAQ:UTHR) reported revenue of $327.5 million, up 13% but $37 million short of consensus. Non-GAAP earnings per share rose 36% to $2.55, above consensus of $2.14, but analysts estimate somewhat differently depending on how they account for the company's oddball method of stock-based compensation, which co-CEO Martine Rothblatt described on the firm's earnings conference call Tuesday as ""shadow stock options that are settled in cash by the company in lieu of having a stock-option plan.""

Rothblatt said management has asked the board to approve a transition to a more conventional stock-option plan, which would help clarify earnings for investors.

3 Of 4 Drugs Miss On Sales

On the more significant revenue metric, three of United's four marketed drugs missed views. Of particular concern to the Street was Orenitram, the oral pulmonary arterial hypertension drug that launched last May. The company had guided a run rate of $100 million by year-end, but Q1 sales were $21 million, $5 million short of consensus and barely up from Q4.

On the call, Rothblatt said this was because most of the 800 patients on Orenitram were new to treprostinil, the working ingredient in Orenitram that is also the basis of United's injectable Remodulin and inhalable Tyvaso. Patients who switch from another form of treprostinil can start on a relatively high dose, Rothblatt said, but new patients have to start on a lower dose and work their way up. Therefore, she said United can still hit its guidance for that drug's sales once the patients work up to a stable dose. She said peak annual sales could hit $1 billion.

Executives do admit to total uncertainty on another permutation of treprostinil that the company is working on, an implantable pump co-developed with Medtronic (NYSE:MDT).

After the close Monday, Medtronic said the FDA filed a consent decree requiring it to stop manufacturing its SynchroMed II pump until some quality-control problems can be worked out. The SynchroMed pump forms the basis of the Remodulin pump.

For example, if the FDA and EMA have both approved the same brand-name drug in their markets, and a European company has already won approval to sell a generic version of the drug in the EU, it would not have to repeat the various studies necessary to show the equivalence of its product to the brand-name version in the U.S. Instead, the company could submit all the same data it gave to the EMA.

An earlier version of the proposal was floated by the European Generic Medicines Association (EGA) to the European Commission in January, and EU negotiators mentioned the proposal at the last TTIP round in Brussels in early February (Inside U.S. Trade, Feb 13). The initial U.S. reaction, however, was skeptical, according to one industry source.

The commission subsequently asked EGA to seek formal support from its U.S. counterpart, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA), in order to show that both groups are aligned. With the joint position paper, the commission this week planned to engage in more substantive talks on the proposal, the source said.

The new paper is essentially identical to the earlier EGA draft, although it contains new information about the legal environment for generic drug approvals in the United States.

Under the proposal, a generic drug company seeking marketing approval would still bear the burden of proving that the brand-name drug -- or ""reference product"" -- that was the subject of its application in the EU is the same as the brand-name drug already approved in the United States, and vice versa.

From a legal perspective, the position paper from the groups argue that neither the U.S. or EU would have to alter the underlying statutes governing drug approval. But it would require both sides to take steps clarifying that firms may use a reference product approved in the jurisdiction of either the U.S. or EU, the paper indicates.

For the EU, this would require the European Commission to ""align"" its interpretation of provisions on the authorization of generic drugs in the relevant law -- Directive 2001/83/EC -- with its interpretation of similar provisions on so-called ""biosimilars,"" the paper says.

Biosimilars are essentially generic versions of advanced biologic drugs, but have different authorization requirements, as it is impossible to exactly replicate the reference product because they are such complex molecules. Under an agreement reached last year through the International Generic Drug Regulators Pilot, the U.S. and EU issued guidelines that allow the makers of biosimilars to use a reference product authorized in the other's market.

But no such guidelines exist for regular -- or small-molecule -- generic drugs, and the EGA-GPhA paper says that EU authorities have generally required the reference product to be sourced from within the European Economic Area, which encompasses the EU's 28 member states along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

For the U.S., the paper says that nothing in the FDA's statute explicitly prevents the use of a foreign reference product in submitting an application for a generic pharmaceutical approval. But it recommends that FDA issue guidance explicitly stating that applicants may use a non-U.S. reference drug, ""provided the applicant suitably demonstrates that the foreign reference product is representative of the listed drug marketed in the U.S.""

ALIBABA

E-Commerce Giant

Tries Produce Delivery

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is stepping up its ability to deliver perishable goods to Chinese consumers with three new fresh-food distribution centers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, the company said late Tuesday.

The so-called ""cold chain"" distribution centers will be owned by partners of Cainiao, a platform that Alibaba established to link regional shipping companies around China so that vendors on Alibaba's e-commerce websites can more easily coordinate national deliveries.

Cainiao plans to expand its cold-chain delivery services to reach 50 major cities in China by the end of the year, a move that would increase the infrastructure available to vendors on Taobao Marketplace and Tmall.com.

Online retailers in China are struggling to keep up with demand for fresh food. Cainiao estimates that 80% of all fruits and vegetables in China are transported at room temperature, leading to as much as 40% spoilage.

MYLAN

Abbott to Use Stake

To Back Perrigo Bid

Abbott Laboratories said Tuesday that it intends to vote its 14.5% stake in Mylan NV in favor of Mylan's proposed acquisition of rival Perrigo Co., a move for Mylan to help it fend off a potential takeover of its own.

""As both Mylan's largest shareholder and its partner through our continued manufacturing relationships, we believe Mylan's stand-alone strategy and acquisition of Perrigo will further enhance its platform,"" said Abbott Chief Executive Miles White.

In a statement, Mylan CEO Robert Coury said he is ""grateful"" for Abbott's support.

In an attempt to stay ahead of the frantic deal-making that is reshaping the drug industry, U.K.-based Mylan in April made an unsolicited $28.9 billion bid to buy Dublin-based Perrigo.

Mylan and Perrigo generally compete in different segments of the generic-drug business. Mylan is best known for selling generic prescription drugs, while Perrigo makes over-the-counter cough and cold remedies and infant formula for chains like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Walgreens, which sell the products under their own names.

Over the past decade, research in many labs has revealed the central role played in this process by opioids and cannabinoids -- chemicals routinely produced by our own brains. This evolutionary development goes back at least 450 million years to bony fish.

Structurally, these homegrown opioids resemble the opium derived from poppies, and homegrown cannabinoids resemble marijuana-derived cannabis. Both have docking sites on specific nerve cells, fitting as a key would into a lock. Through these receptors, the molecules change the way a nerve cell behaves -- and hence how we feel.

Humans and other animals can get high from opium and its derivatives only because brains are normally wired with receptors for brain-generated opioids. If it weren't for our cannabinoid receptors, smoking pot would be like smoking oregano. Counterbalancing the advantages of our brain-generated opioids and cannabinoids is the grim fact that our receptors allow for addiction to external sources, such as heroin and cannabis.

The opioids and cannabinoids we make act very similarly to morphine when it comes to dulling pain transmitted by pain-sensitive neurons. Imaging studies show that when a person's pain ebbs, the pattern of brain changes is much the same whether it happens in response to a genuine analgesic such as morphine or to a placebo treatment. In both cases, multiple brain networks are affected, including structures known to regulate stress, fear, learning based on rewards and how we experience pain.

Placebos trigger the release of these chemicals under two conditions. One involves a social situation, such as reassurances from an admired or trusted physician. A subject expects a beneficial effect because of his deep-seated beliefs, his feelings and social attitudes. Just nibbling on snap beans with the hope of reducing joint pain is unlikely to do the trick.

Alternatively, a patient whose pain is diminished by morphine may, after repeated morphine injections, respond equally well to a placebo injection. This is called experience-dependent learning. In this case, the brain's reward system has learned to expect pain reduction following an injection, and that expectation drives down the brain activities that sustain pain. Rats and dogs likewise have been found to display a placebo response that depends on such associations.

But we still don't understand well the precise mechanisms that produce an uptick in homegrown opioid and cannabinoid action in anticipation of a therapeutic benefit. And not everyone responds to placebos.

Why not? In a 2013 paper in the journal Neuropsychoparmacology, Marta Pecina and Jon-Kar Zubieta at the University of Michigan and colleagues showed that people who have demonstrated physiological and psychological resilience in the face of stress, disease and injury also tend to respond well to placebos. A follow-up study by the researchers pointed to genetic factors. About half the population carries a genetic variant that results in more cannabinoids lingering in the body. But genes probably only partly explain the heightened effect of placebos.

So yes, a patient's placebo response is entirely in his head: He has a brain wired to exploit its own chemical helpers when it creates them in eager anticipation of relief.

Both have docking sites on specific nerve cells, fitting as a key would into a lock. Through these receptors, the molecules change the way a nerve cell behaves -- and hence how we feel.

Humans and other animals can get high from opium and its derivatives only because brains are normally wired with receptors for brain-generated opioids. If it weren't for our cannabinoid receptors, smoking pot would be like smoking oregano. Counterbalancing the advantages of our brain-generated opioids and cannabinoids is the grim fact that our receptors allow for addiction to external sources, such as heroin and cannabis.

The opioids and cannabinoids we make act very similarly to morphine when it comes to dulling pain transmitted by pain-sensitive neurons. Imaging studies show that when a person's pain ebbs, the pattern of brain changes is much the same whether it happens in response to a genuine analgesic such as morphine or to a placebo treatment. In both cases, multiple brain networks are affected, including structures known to regulate stress, fear, learning based on rewards and how we experience pain.

Placebos trigger the release of these chemicals under two conditions. One involves a social situation, such as reassurances from an admired or trusted physician. A subject expects a beneficial effect because of his deep-seated beliefs, his feelings and social attitudes. Just nibbling on snap beans with the hope of reducing joint pain is unlikely to do the trick.

Alternatively, a patient whose pain is diminished by morphine may, after repeated morphine injections, respond equally well to a placebo injection. This is called experience-dependent learning. In this case, the brain's reward system has learned to expect pain reduction following an injection, and that expectation drives down the brain activities that sustain pain. Rats and dogs likewise have been found to display a placebo response that depends on such associations.

But we still don't understand well the precise mechanisms that produce an uptick in homegrown opioid and cannabinoid action in anticipation of a therapeutic benefit. And not everyone responds to placebos.

Why not? In a 2013 paper in the journal Neuropsychoparmacology, Marta Pecina and Jon-Kar Zubieta at the University of Michigan and colleagues showed that people who have demonstrated physiological and psychological resilience in the face of stress, disease and injury also tend to respond well to placebos. A follow-up study by the researchers pointed to genetic factors. About half the population carries a genetic variant that results in more cannabinoids lingering in the body. But genes probably only partly explain the heightened effect of placebos.

So yes, a patient's placebo response is entirely in his head: He has a brain wired to exploit its own chemical helpers when it creates them in eager anticipation of relief.

Federal regulators ordered Volkswagen AG to provide additional details on a Takata Corp. air bag that ruptured in a sport-utility vehicle in June, widening a government probe that has led to the largest automotive recall in U.S. history.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Monday called on Volkswagen to provide more information on an incident in which a side-curtain air bag in a 2015 Volkswagen Tiguan SUV ruptured on June 7 in Missouri. No one was seriously injured or required medical attention. The German auto maker disclosed the incident to regulators on July 15, the auto-safety agency said.

While regulators asked Volkswagen for information as part of a continuing probe and oversight of Takata, both companies said the incident appeared unrelated to air-bag problems currently under scrutiny. Those cases involve older vehicles and ruptures that often occur after parts have aged and experienced prolonged exposure to heat and high humidity.

""Volkswagen at this point considers this an individual case,"" a spokesman said.

A Takata spokesman said the company continues to investigate the air bag's malfunction, and cooperate with Volkswagen and regulators but believes it is unrelated to previous recalls. The Japanese supplier, like Volkswagen, also received the equivalent of a subpoena from regulators requesting information about the incident and must respond by Aug. 24. The Detroit News earlier reported on the special orders.

AMGEN

Drug Maker Reaches

Settlement With States

Amgen Inc. reached a $71 million settlement with 48 states related to allegations that the biotechnology company made unsubstantiated marketing claims about blockbuster drugs Aranesp and Enbrel, according to several state attorneys general.

In a statement on Tuesday, Amgen said the settlement with the states resolves some of the same issues addressed in Amgen's December 2012 settlement with the federal government related to the company's marketing practices.

The 2012 settlement resolved criminal and civil liability claims related to marketing for Aranesp and Enbrel. Under the roughly $150 million settlement Amgen pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of misbranding relating to Aransep.

The $71 million settlement announced Tuesday covers a total of 48 states and the District of Columbia.

The allegations included accusations that Amgen promoted Aranesp for dosing frequencies beyond the levels approved by the Food and Drug Administration, promoted Aranesp for anemia caused by cancer without FDA approval and promoted Enbrel for mild plaque psoriasis though it had FDA approval to treat only moderate to severe cases of the disease.

In some aspects, the invention relates to detection of laboratory animal motion.

""In the discovery of neurological drugs, e.g., analgesics, many animal pain models are used. In one such model, a small amount of formalin is injected into one rear paw of a rat. The resulting irritation causes the rat to lick and/or to shake this paw in a repetitive, flinch-like motion. This reaction is considered a painful response. A test compound is administered to the rat after the formalin injection and changes in paw motion counts are used to assess the compound's analgesic effect. In other tests, a rat paw is exposed to a heat source and the motion of the paw is monitored as the rats are exposed to various neurological compounds. Such tests can be used to screen analgesic compounds or to perform other neurological experiments.

""Currently, the most commonly used instrumentation for detecting rat paw motion employs a metal detector to sense the motion of a metallic bracelet attached to a paw. With reference to FIG. 1, a metal detector typically consists of two induction coils. A transmitter coil 100 is energized with a relatively low-frequency (5-10 KHz) AC signal. A receiver coil 110 is concentric and coplanar with the transmitter coil 100. The coils are only weakly coupled through free space. When a small piece of metal (e.g., a rat paw bracelet 120) is introduced into the area above the two coils, the coupling is increased and a stronger signal is detected by the receiver coils 110. The metallic bracelet 120 concentrates the magnetic flux so that more field lines are captured by the receiver coil 110, giving rise to a stronger detected signal. As this design relies on the phenomenon of flux concentration, bracelets made from high magnetic permeability metals give rise to the largest signals. Overall, this effect is weak and a very high level of amplification is needed to detect it.

""In a typical laboratory environment, this design suffers from several disadvantages. First, there is usually a significant amount of metal in a typical lab, often causing mistriggering of the device. For example, wristwatches worn by the operators are a common source of interference. Second, the receiver coil's 110 cross-section is large and a very high level of amplification is used causing stray magnetic fields from various power sources to elicit false signals. Third, multiple detectors cannot be placed too close to each other because stray magnetic induction from one unit tends to falsely trigger its nearest neighbors. Thus, there is a need for improved motion detectors, particularly for use in detecting rodent paw motion.""

At a Grand Opening event last Friday, clinicians introduced the new system, which enables advanced forms of treatment including radiosurgery, a precise method of using carefully shaped high-energy radiation beams to attack a tumor from outside the body, without performing surgery.",JOENG,Journal of Engineering,False,"['gcancr', 'gtrea', 'nnam', 'ccat', 'gcat', 'ghea', 'gmed', 'ncat', 'nfact', 'nfce', 'niwe']",Varian Medical Systems; Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital to Deliver First TrueBeam STx Radiosurgery Treatments in Singapore,"Varian Medical Systems; Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital to Deliver First TrueBeam STx Radiosurgery Treatments in Singapore""We are scheduled to deliver our first patient treatment this week,"" said Dr. Lee Kuo Ann, MBBS, FRCR, FAMS, consultant radiation oncologist at Mount Elizabeth Novena. ""The TrueBeam system will enable us to deliver large doses to tumors with great precision. We'll be able to treat many inoperable brain tumors, tumors that are close to the spinal cord, and tumors of the lung, liver, or pancreas, which are subject to respiratory motion during treatment. The system includes gating technology that can enhance precision by compensating for that kind of tumor motion.""

About the TrueBeam STx System The TrueBeam STx system was designed to treat tumors with tremendous accuracy and speed. The system incorporates numerous technical innovations that dynamically synchronize advanced imaging, patient positioning, motion management, and treatment delivery during a radiotherapy or radiosurgery procedure in order to target tumors precisely. TrueBeam STx has been designed to advance the treatment of lung, breast, intracranial, prostate, head and neck, and other types of cancer.

With its High Intensity Mode, TrueBeam STx can accurately deliver high doses more than twice as fast as earlier generations of technology. It incorporates a unique high-resolution beam shaping device that shapes the treatment beam so that it matches the three-dimensional shape of the targeted tumor, minimizing the impact on surrounding healthy tissues.

""With gating, the High Intensity Mode, and imaging technologies, we will be able to minimize the impact of treatment on healthy tissues,"" said Dr. Lee. ""For example, during breast cancer treatments we can reduce the radiation going to the heart and lungs.""

""Varian's mission is to help save millions of lives around the world every year. We are pleased and honored that the outstanding clinical team at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital will be working to save lives using Varian's advanced technology for treating cancer,"" saidJean-Luc Devleeschauwer, president for the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region for Varian's Oncology Systems business.

Spinal cord stimulators alleviate pain by stimulating the nerve fibers in the spinal cord to reduce pain signals. While primary cell (also referred to as non-rechargeable) devices are typically larger due to limitations in technology and battery size, the Precision Novi System represents a significant technology advance, with the smallest high-capacity battery on the market, allowing effective pain relief to be delivered from a much smaller device. The Precision Novi System is also the only primary cell device that couples with a wireless remote , empowering patients with flexibility and control over their pain management.

""The small size and novel shape of the Precision Novi implant improves patient comfort and enables a very discreet subcutaneous placement,"" said Dr. Simon Thomson, a consultant in Pain Management and Neuromodulation at Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals, UK. ""The simplicity of the programming software saves valuable time in the operating theatre, efficiently allowing me to achieve and maintain comfortable therapy for my patients.""

Unlike any other primary cell system, the Precision Novi intuitive Illumina 3D neural targeting software incorporates three-dimensional lead location, as well as the conductivity of the spinal cord and surrounding tissue. This point-and-click technology automatically calculates the optimal programming configuration to target the selected pain area. Further, unique for primary cell devices, Precision Novi is a MultiWave(TM) Platform capable of delivering a variety of field shapes and waveforms with or without paresthesia, including burst and higher rate frequencies.

Spinal cord stimulators alleviate pain by stimulating the nerve fibers in the spinal cord to reduce pain signals. While primary cell (also referred to as non-rechargeable) devices are typically larger due to limitations in technology and battery size, the Precision Novi System represents a significant technology advance, with the smallest high-capacity battery on the market, allowing effective pain relief to be delivered from a much smaller device. The Precision Novi System is also the only primary cell device that couples with a wireless remote , empowering patients with flexibility and control over their pain management.

Typical formulations for oral administration include liquid solutions, emulsions, or suspensions, as well as solid forms such as capsules or tablets. Solid oral dosage formulations are usually intended for adults who can easily swallow large tablets whole, the often disagreeable taste of the active ingredient need not be taken into account in formulating the medicine, except for the provision of means to prevent the taste from being apparent during the short time that the medicine is in the mouth. Such means may include the provision of an appropriate coating on the tablet, the use of a capsule form (the gelatin outer shell of the capsule keeps the active ingredient inside until the capsule has been swallowed), or simply firmly compressing a tablet so that it will not begin to disintegrate during the short time that it is intended to be in the mouth.

""Children, older persons, and many other persons have difficulty swallowing whole tablets and even capsules.

A oral liquid dosage form has many advantages for pediatric patients and for elderly patients. Many medicines have bitter or an otherwise disagreeable taste and this can be a significant problem. A further requirement of any dosage form is that it must be bioavailable; that is, once the formulation reaches the stomach, the formulation should release the active ingredient rapidly and completely to ensure that substantially the entire amount of the active ingredient is absorbed.

This can present problems in maintaining proper bioavailability either because crystal size can affect absorption rate or because the re-crystallization process can alter the polymorphic form of the suspended crystals and the altered form may have a different bioavailability. Thus there is a need for a suspension formulation that reduces the rate of re-crystallization and/or change in polymorphic form of a slightly soluble crystalline compound such as carisbamate.""

This market segment is experiencing healthy growth at a CAGR of 7.5%. Meanwhile, the holmium laser segment is expected to grow at a rapid CAGR of 8.1% through 2020, making it the fastest growing segment in the stone management market. Holmium lasers are the only type of lasers used in stone management. Procedures in which they are used are referred to as laser lithotripsy procedures.

Many urologists consider high powered holmium lasers, which are defined as over 80 watts, to be a cost-effective investment. This is due to the fact that the devices can be used not only for stone treatment, but also for laser benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) treatment. The use of holmium lasers in multiple applications and its consequent returns on investments makes them very appealing, thus driving the overall stone treatment device market.

Lumenis, whose holmium laser technology is distributed by Boston Scientific, is the market leader for holmium lasers. Lumenis is the largest medical laser company in the world and it was the first company to develop a 100-watt holmium laser, as seen in its VersaPulse® PowerSuite system. Also a significant competitor in this market segment is Dornier MedTech America, with its H20 Holmium laser system from the Medilas product family, which is distributed by Olympus.

On the ureteral stents front, the clear market leader is Boston Scientific with their successful Percuflex, Contour and Polaris families of products. Also prominent in this segment is Cook Medical, who offers the C-Flex®, Sof-Flex® and Universa® lines of stents. C. R. Bard is also among the leaders of this market with their popular INLAY ®and BARDEX® family of ureteral stents.

""An emerging technology is antimicrobial coated stents, which have not yet gained FDA approval but could increase demand in the future,"" explains Dr. Kamran Zamanian, CEO of iData.

Innovation appears to be administration regimen (novel combination of two drugs, but it's unclear if the drugs are new)",,Unsure,Unsure,No,"Full details of the Phase 3 clinical trial, called the UNITY-CLL trial, will be released at the launch of the study. The general study design is a randomized controlled clinical trial that includes two key objectives: first, to demonstrate contribution of each agent in the TG-1101 + TGR-1202 regimen (the combination sometimes referred to as ""1303""), and second, to demonstrate superiority in Progression Free Survival (PFS) over the standard of care to support the submission for full approval of the combination. The study will randomize patients into four treatment arms: TG-1101 + TGR-1202, TG-1101 alone, TGR-1202 alone, and an active control arm of obinutuzumab + chlorambucil. An early interim analysis will assess contribution of each single agent in the TG-1101 + TGR-1202 combination regimen, which, if successful, will allow early termination of both single agent arms. A second interim analysis will be conducted following full enrollment into the study, which, if positive, the Company plans to utilize for accelerated approval. Assuming early termination of the TG-1101 and TGR-1202 single agent arms, the study will enroll approximately 450 patients.

Dr. John Gribben, Professor of Medicine and the Gordon Hamilton Fairley Chair of Medical Oncology at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Cancer Institute in London, UK, will lead the UNITY-CLL Phase 3 as Study Chair. Dr. Gribben commented, ""The recent introduction of novel targeted agents has already dramatically improved the standard of care for patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, and we have seen even greater activity when these agents are used in combination. Both ublituximab and TGR-1202 have demonstrated unique activity and tolerability as single agents, and in combination together. We are excited to lead this important and innovative trial, which has the potential to bring greater advances to patients in both the front-line and relapsed/refractory CLL setting.""

Michael S. Weiss, Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of TG Therapeutics, stated, ""Our number one goal has always been to accelerate the development of novel non-chemotherapy-based combination treatments for patients with B-cell malignancies. The UNITY-CLL study and the related SPA marks a major milestone for the Company and, if successful, could lead to a very broad label in the treatment of CLL, providing patients and physicians a new treatment option, and the Company a platform to build additional proprietary combinations in our continued effort to drive towards a cure. Our path to achieving this SPA, which we believe is the first for two novel investigational agents in the oncology division, was the result of a true collaboration with the FDA, for which we would like to recognize and thank the agency for its invaluable guidance throughout this process."" Mr. Weiss continued, ""Our clinical team has been hard at work preparing for the launch of this study, and we look forward to enrolling our first patients as soon as possible. Lastly, we are thrilled to have Dr. Gribben, a world-renowned authority in CLL, lead this important international study and share in his excitement in bringing our novel, non-chemotherapy combination regimen to patients in need.""

ABOUT TG THERAPEUTICS, INC.

TG Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Currently, the Company is developing two therapies targeting hematological malignancies.

The delta isoform of PI3K is strongly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin and is believed to be important in the proliferation and survival of B?lymphocytes. Both TG-1101 and TGR-1202 are in clinical development for patients with hematologic malignancies. The Company also has pre-clinical programs to develop IRAK4 inhibitors, and anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies. TG Therapeutics is headquartered in New York City.

About Special Protocol Assessments

The Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for a new drug application.

Final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 clinical program. The SPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product efficacy or safety. For more information on Special Protocol Assessment, please visit: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080571.pdf.

Cautionary Statement

Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those with respect to anticipating future clinical trials, the timing of commencing or completing such trials and business prospects for TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program, and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies may be forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are the following: our ability to successfully and cost-effectively complete pre-clinical and clinical trials for TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies; the risk that early pre-clinical and clinical results that supported our decision to move forward with TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies will not be reproduced in additional patients or in future studies; the risk that trends observed which underlie certain assumptions of future performance of TGR-1202 will not continue, the risk that TGR-1202 will not produce satisfactory safety and efficacy results to warrant further development following the completion of the current Phase 1 study; the risk that the data (both safety and efficacy) from future clinical trials will not coincide with the data produced from prior pre-clinical and clinical trials; the risk that trials will take longer to enroll than expected; our ability to achieve the milestones we project over the next year; our ability to manage our cash in line with our projections, and other risk factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(Nasdaq:TGTX) announced today that it has reached an agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) on the design of a Phase 3 clinical trial for its proprietary combination of TG-1101 (ublituximab), its glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, plus TGR-1202, the Company's once-daily PI3K-delta inhibitor, for the treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). The SPA provides agreement that the Phase 3 trial design adequately addresses objectives that, if met, would support the regulatory submission for drug approval of both TG-1101 and TGR-1202 in combination.",JORTI,The Jordan Times,True,"['ctrial', 'cappro', 'c13', 'c22', 'c23', 'ccat', 'ncat', 'nfact', 'nfcpin']",TG Therapeutics Announces Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) Agreement With the FDA for the First Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Its Proprietary Combination Regimen of TG-1101 (ublituximab) in Combination With TGR-1202 for Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leuk,"TG Therapeutics Announces Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) Agreement With the FDA for the First Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Its Proprietary Combination Regimen of TG-1101 (ublituximab) in Combination With TGR-1202 for Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic LeukFull details of the Phase 3 clinical trial, called the UNITY-CLL trial, will be released at the launch of the study. The general study design is a randomized controlled clinical trial that includes two key objectives: first, to demonstrate contribution of each agent in the TG-1101 + TGR-1202 regimen (the combination sometimes referred to as ""1303""), and second, to demonstrate superiority in Progression Free Survival (PFS) over the standard of care to support the submission for full approval of the combination. The study will randomize patients into four treatment arms: TG-1101 + TGR-1202, TG-1101 alone, TGR-1202 alone, and an active control arm of obinutuzumab + chlorambucil. An early interim analysis will assess contribution of each single agent in the TG-1101 + TGR-1202 combination regimen, which, if successful, will allow early termination of both single agent arms. A second interim analysis will be conducted following full enrollment into the study, which, if positive, the Company plans to utilize for accelerated approval. Assuming early termination of the TG-1101 and TGR-1202 single agent arms, the study will enroll approximately 450 patients.

Dr. John Gribben, Professor of Medicine and the Gordon Hamilton Fairley Chair of Medical Oncology at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Cancer Institute in London, UK, will lead the UNITY-CLL Phase 3 as Study Chair. Dr. Gribben commented, ""The recent introduction of novel targeted agents has already dramatically improved the standard of care for patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, and we have seen even greater activity when these agents are used in combination. Both ublituximab and TGR-1202 have demonstrated unique activity and tolerability as single agents, and in combination together. We are excited to lead this important and innovative trial, which has the potential to bring greater advances to patients in both the front-line and relapsed/refractory CLL setting.""

Michael S. Weiss, Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of TG Therapeutics, stated, ""Our number one goal has always been to accelerate the development of novel non-chemotherapy-based combination treatments for patients with B-cell malignancies. The UNITY-CLL study and the related SPA marks a major milestone for the Company and, if successful, could lead to a very broad label in the treatment of CLL, providing patients and physicians a new treatment option, and the Company a platform to build additional proprietary combinations in our continued effort to drive towards a cure. Our path to achieving this SPA, which we believe is the first for two novel investigational agents in the oncology division, was the result of a true collaboration with the FDA, for which we would like to recognize and thank the agency for its invaluable guidance throughout this process."" Mr. Weiss continued, ""Our clinical team has been hard at work preparing for the launch of this study, and we look forward to enrolling our first patients as soon as possible. Lastly, we are thrilled to have Dr. Gribben, a world-renowned authority in CLL, lead this important international study and share in his excitement in bringing our novel, non-chemotherapy combination regimen to patients in need.""

ABOUT TG THERAPEUTICS, INC.

TG Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Currently, the Company is developing two therapies targeting hematological malignancies. TG-1101 (ublituximab) is a novel, glycoengineered monoclonal antibody that targets a specific and unique epitope on the CD20 antigen found on mature B-lymphocytes. TG Therapeutics is also developing TGR-1202, an orally available PI3K delta inhibitor. The delta isoform of PI3K is strongly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin and is believed to be important in the proliferation and survival of B?lymphocytes. Both TG-1101 and TGR-1202 are in clinical development for patients with hematologic malignancies. The Company also has pre-clinical programs to develop IRAK4 inhibitors, and anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies. TG Therapeutics is headquartered in New York City.

About Special Protocol Assessments

The Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for a new drug application.

Final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 clinical program. The SPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product efficacy or safety. For more information on Special Protocol Assessment, please visit: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080571.pdf.

Cautionary Statement

Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those with respect to anticipating future clinical trials, the timing of commencing or completing such trials and business prospects for TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program, and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies may be forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are the following: our ability to successfully and cost-effectively complete pre-clinical and clinical trials for TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies; the risk that early pre-clinical and clinical results that supported our decision to move forward with TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies will not be reproduced in additional patients or in future studies; the risk that trends observed which underlie certain assumptions of future performance of TGR-1202 will not continue, the risk that TGR-1202 will not produce satisfactory safety and efficacy results to warrant further development following the completion of the current Phase 1 study; the risk that the data (both safety and efficacy) from future clinical trials will not coincide with the data produced from prior pre-clinical and clinical trials; the risk that trials will take longer to enroll than expected; our ability to achieve the milestones we project over the next year; our ability to manage our cash in line with our projections, and other risk factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

GlaxoSmithKline was selling the drug for about $1 a tablet. In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline sold Daraprim to CorePharma. CorePharma promptly raised the price to $13.5o a tablet for a pill that costs less than $1 to manufacture. In August, Turing purchased the drug and last week increased the price of the drug to at least $750 a pill.

And then it happened.

Leftists across the nation erupted in that sanctimonious shrill fury they unleash every time it some behaves in a fashion contrary to what their warped perceptions of what is proper.

These whiny leftists, just like a broken record, defamed capitalism and called for more government regulations.

After the outrage from the left, Turing agreed to lower the price.

However, once the facts are examined, a different picture emerges.

The drug, while on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, is not in much demand in the United States. Last year, there were only 8,821 prescriptions for the drug. So right from the outset very few people were going to be affected by the price increase.

Additionally, the company is participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which guarantees that Medicaid patients and hospitals who service those patients will get the drug at a greatly reduced price. The company has also agreed to provide the drug free or at discounted prices to those who can't afford it.

In essence, the only people who will actually pay the full price for the drug are the ones who can afford it. Isn't that what the leftists want, i.e., make the rich pay more?

Another fact leftists ignore is that this drug is not the only drug available. If one can't afford this drug, there are cheaper alternatives.

Several antibiotics, including clindamycin, spiramycin, minocycline, and atovaquone, are available. Furthermore, most of these products are significantly less expensive than pyrimethamine. Clindamycin, for example, costs somewhere between 50 cents to slightly more than $3 per tablet.

The real tragedy, though, is how government interference has pretty much prevented the market from effectively dealing with the price increase.

Normally, in an unfettered free market, if a drug company raised its price more than 5,000 percent, another company would step in and offer a generic version of the drug. There is nothing legally stopping a company from manufacturing a generic version of pyrimethamine.

However, Food and Drug Administration regulations related to bringing a drug to market, even a generic copy, are onerous, costly and time consuming.

A generic might be profitable, but not if a company has to comply with the costly FDA regulations to bring a low-demand drug to market. In essence, government regulations shield Turing from competition and allow it to raise its prices with impunity.

Finally, leftists miss the basic economics involved. Drug companies must make a profit if they are to research new and better drugs. They can't simply give them away. They need the money for research. The money also serves as an incentive to create more life-saving drugs.

If a cure for cancer is found, it will be because some drug company took a risk and spent a large amount of money researching the problem in hopes of a payout later.

That is how we all are. None of us want to, or should, work for free, even if what we do is essential.

Unfortunately your average leftist has an entitlement attitude: They want paid for their own work, but hope to benefit from the labor of others without paying for it.

Mylan said on Thursday that it would go forward with the deal if it received more than 50 percent of shares through the tender offer.

U.S. teens don't exercise enough at school

(Reuters Health) - Even though teens get more exercise at school than anywhere else, it still isn't enough to meet minimum daily activity levels recommended for good physical and mental health, a U.S. study suggests. Children and teens should get at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity every day, the World Health Organization recommends. But in the U.S., only an estimated 8 percent of youth meet this standard, researchers report in the journal Pediatrics.

Once-a-week diabetes meds are similar in safety and effectiveness

There's little difference in the performance of five new once-a-week drugs to treat diabetes when they're compared to one another, though small differences in side effects emerge, according to a new review of existing evidence. Past studies of the drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists - or GLP-1RAs - have found that the medications improve blood sugar control and reduce body weight, but the review's lead author said no research had compared the various versions head-to-head.

Serial measurements of spine and hip BMD and biochemical markers of bone turnover were performed. Overall, 120 women were enrolled in the study (mean age 65.8 years, mean lumbar spine T-score -2.8). Blosozumab treatment resulted in statistically significant dose-related increases in spine, femoral neck, and total hip BMD as compared with placebo. In the highest dose group, BMD increases from baseline reached 17.7% at the spine, and 6.2% at the total hip. Biochemical markers of bone formation increased rapidly during blosozumab treatment, and trended toward pretreatment levels by study end. However, bone specific alkaline phosphatase remained higher than placebo at study end in the highest-dose group. CTx, a biochemical marker of bone resorption, decreased early in blosozumab treatment to a concentration less than that of the placebo group by 2 weeks, and remained reduced throughout blosozumab treatment. Mild injection site reactions were reported more frequently with blosozumab than placebo.""

According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""Treatment of postmenopausal women with an antibody targeted against sclerostin resulted in substantial increases in spine and hip BMD. These results support further study of blosozumab as a potential anabolic therapy for osteoporosis.""

Data reported at the 37th Annual Charing Cross 2015 Symposium in London demonstrate safe and effective dilatation of calcified stenosis with no acute failures, favorable residual stenosis, no major device-related adverse events and no need for stent placement. Six-month durability was excellent with no need for re-treatment and patency by duplex ultrasound of 83%.

""We are very pleased to work with such a high quality group of investors to continue advancing the development of Lithoplasty,"" said Shockwave Medical CEO and co-founder Daniel Hawkins. ""We believe the Lithoplasty system is uniquely suited to address substantial unmet needs in the treatment of patients with peripheral, coronary and aortic valve disease using a balloon-based approach that is inherently familiar to physicians. Our returning and new investors provide us the depth of resources and breadth of support needed to achieve our goal of changing the paradigm in the treatment of advanced cardiovascular disease.""

""We were very impressed with the level of interest and the quality of the investor group that Shockwave was able to bring into this new funding round, with blue-chip financial investors as well as two major corporate investors,"" said Antoine Papiernik, managing partner of Sofinnova Partners. ""This is a tribute to the strength of the Lithoplasty technology as well as to the work that management has done to develop it to this stage.""

""Shockwave has the potential to significantly improve the treatment of advanced cardiovascular disease with products based on an intuitive, simple platform technology. We are encouraged by the success to date and look forward to helping the management team build a world-class company,"" said Colin Cahill, vice president at Venrock.

In advanced vascular disease, atherosclerosis becomes calcified deep inside the vessel walls, limiting blood flow. These deposits are difficult to treat because they limit the effectiveness of current endovascular devices, making today's interventions challenging and prone to both procedural and long-term failure. Lithoplasty is a novel balloon-based technology that utilizes integrated lithotripsy, a pulsatile mechanical energy commonly used to break up kidney stones, to disrupt both superficial and deep calcium and normalize vessel wall compliance prior to low-pressure balloon dilatation. Lithoplasty is designed to be naturally gentle to soft tissue (non-diseased portions of the vessel) while remaining hard on calcium, the tissue that limits vessel expansion and the effectiveness of current technologies. About Shockwave's Lithoplasty(R) System Delivered on a standard balloon catheter platform, Lithoplasty combines the calcium disrupting power of lithotripsy with the familiarity and simplicity of a balloon in a single enabling device. Lithoplasty applies a brief series of powerful mechanical pulses designed to safely travel through soft tissue and disrupt calcium. The integrated balloon is then dilated at low pressures to expand the lesion evenly, potentially minimizing acute soft tissue injury that could lead to the need for additional interventional treatments or long-term restenosis (re-blockage). Unlike current devices that treat only superficial calcium, Shockwave's Lithoplasty system is designed to be effective on all types of calcium, including deep - the type known to limit vessel expansion.

Early clinical results demonstrate safety, tolerability, deliverability, and effectiveness for Lithoplasty as a treatment for patients with peripheral artery disease and as a pre-treatment of calcified coronary lesions prior to stenting. Clinical work will begin in aortic valves within the coming year. Shockwave has received CE Mark for use of Lithoplasty in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Lithoplasty is not available for sale in the United States.

Upon receiving Tentative Approval from the FDA Aurobindo Pharma will be able to supply dolutegravir 50mg via the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) programme following completion of required local regulatory approval process in the licensed countries outside of the United States as per the agreement signed between Aurobindo Pharma and ViiV Healthcare in 2014.

This submission comes less than five years after ViiV Healthcare and CHAI signed an agreement to collaborate with the goal of bringing innovative formulations of medicines for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS to people living with HIV in developing countries on an affordable yet sustainable basis.

CHAI and ViiV Healthcare worked together to identify a generic partner after conducting feasibility research. Following this initial joint work ViiV Healthcare submitted necessary documentation to the FDA providing a selective waiver letter for the five-year period of New Chemical Entity (NCE) exclusivity that would have otherwise prevented FDA review and Tentative Approval of Aurobindo Pharma's ANDA at this time.

Dr. Dominique Limet CEO ViiV Healthcare said: 'This first ANDA for a generic dolutegravir confirms that our strong commitment to thinking and acting differently to pursue new ways to expand access to our medicines for people living with HIV in countries where the need is most pressing is working.'

David Ripin PhD Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer CHAI said: 'UNAIDS has set global public health goals calling for 90 percent of those who are HIV-positive to know their status 90 percent of those identified to be linked to treatment programs and 90 percent of those in treatment to achieve undetectable viral load. To tackle these complex challenges targeted efforts to facilitate access to HIV treatment medicines such as dolutegravir are needed.'

Mr. N. Govindarajan Managing Director Aurobindo Pharma said: 'We are pleased to be part of this innovative partnership designed to accelerate access to medicines for treating HIV. Aurobindo Pharma is committed to HIV care and aims to achieve the goals of wider access to HIV treatment care and support; seeking to address the spread of HIV through development of this newer class of drugs and fixed-dose combinations for low- and middle-income countries. '

The filing by Aurobindo Pharma is the second result of the agreement between CHAI and ViiV Healthcare and comes less than six months after another generic manufacturer announced that it had received Tentative Approval from the FDA for paediatric formulations of another ViiV Healthcare antiretroviral (also under PEPFAR for sale in licensed countries outside of the United States) through innovative collaboration with ViiV Healthcare and CHAI.

About Clinton Health Access Initiative

The Clinton Health Access Initiative Inc. (CHAI) (http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org) was founded in 2002 with a transformational goal: help save the lives of millions of people living with HIV/AIDS in the developing world by dramatically scaling up antiretroviral treatment. When CHAI was founded many viewed this goal as unreasonable because health systems in poor countries were too weak and prices of relevant drugs and diagnostic tests were too high. CHAI played a leadership role working alongside governments and other partners to lower the costs of treatment and help build the in-country systems necessary to provide lifesaving treatment to millions of people. Since then CHAI has pursued several similarly ambitious goals from scaling up pediatric AIDS treatment in order to achieve equity with adults in a timeframe few thought possible to rapidly accelerating the rollout of new vaccines. CHAI has achieved many of its most important successes when seeking to fundamentally change the way the world approaches an issue and pushing the boundaries of what is considered feasible in global health.

About President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)

PEPFAR is the US government initiative to help save the lives of those suffering from HIV/AIDS around the world. This historic commitment is the largest by any nation to combat a single disease internationally. In May 2004 in support of the President's Emergency Plan the FDA announced a new initiative to help ensure that those being served by the President's Plan would receive safe effective and quality manufactured antiretroviral drugs. This new initiative included an expedited review process. Through guidance and an active outreach program to the pharmaceutical industry the FDA actively encouraged any sponsors worldwide to submit US marketing applications for single entity fixed dose combination (FDC) and co-packaged versions of previously approved antiretroviral therapies-even if there was still patent or exclusivity market protection for the product in the US.

Important Information about Tivicay� (dolutegravir) in the US

FDA Indication and Usage: TIVICAY is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

Use of TIVICAY in INSTI-experienced patients should be guided by the number and type of baseline INSTI substitutions. The efficacy of TIVICAY 50 mg twice daily is reduced in patients with an INSTI-resistance Q148 substitution plus 2 or more additional INSTI-resistance substitutions including T66A L74I/M E138A/K/T G140S/A/C Y143R/C/H E157Q G163S/E/K/Q or G193E/R.

Important Safety Information for Tivicay� (dolutegravir)

Contraindication: TIVICAY is contraindicated (1) in patients with previous hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir and (2) in patients receiving dofetilide (antiarrhythmic) due to the potential for increased dofetilide plasma concentrations and the risk for serious and/or life-threatening events.

Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported and were characterized by rash constitutional findings and sometimes organ dysfunction including liver injury. The events were reported in 1% or fewer subjects receiving TIVICAY in Phase 3 clinical trials. Discontinue TIVICAY and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction develop (including but not limited to severe rash or rash accompanied by fever general malaise fatigue muscle or joint aches blisters or peeling of the skin oral blisters or lesions conjunctivitis facial edema hepatitis eosinophilia angioedema difficulty breathing.) Monitor clinical status including liver aminotransferases and initiate appropriate therapy. Delay in stopping treatment with TIVICAY or other suspect agents after the onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening reaction. TIVICAY is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir.

Effects on Serum Liver Biochemistries in Patients with Hepatitis B or C Coinfection: Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of TIVICAY. In some cases the elevations in transaminases were consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or hepatitis B reactivation particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn. Appropriate laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with TIVICAY are recommended in patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C.

Fat Redistribution: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat has been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.

Immune Reconstitution Syndrome: During the initial phase of treatment immune reconstitution syndrome can occur which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders have been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

Adverse Reactions: The most commonly reported (=2%) adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity in treatment nave adult subjects in any one trial receiving TIVICAY in a combination regimen were insomnia (3%) fatigue (2%) and headache (2%).

Drug Interactions: Co-administration of TIVICAY with drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 and/or CYP3A4 may result in reduced plasma concentrations of dolutegravir and require dose adjustments of TIVICAY.

- TIVICAY should be taken2 hours before or 6 hours after taking cation-containing antacids or laxatives sucralfate oral iron supplements oral calcium supplements or buffered medications.

- Consult the full Prescribing Information for TIVICAY for more information on potentially significant drug interactions including clinical comments.

Pregnancy: Pregnancy category B. TIVICAY should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. An Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established.

Breastfeeding: Breastfeeding is NOT recommended due to the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants.

Paediatric Patients: Safety and efficacy of TIVICAY has not been established in children younger than 12 years old or weighing 40 kg or in INSTI-experienced paediatric patients with documented or clinically suspected INSTI resistance.

How Tivicay Works

Tivicay belongs to a class of HIV medicines called integrase inhibitors. Integrase inhibitors block HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic infection.

Upon receiving Tentative Approval from the FDA Aurobindo Pharma will be able to supply dolutegravir 50mg via the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) programme following completion of required local regulatory approval process in the licensed countries outside of the United States as per the agreement signed between Aurobindo Pharma and ViiV Healthcare in 2014.

This submission comes less than five years after ViiV Healthcare and CHAI signed an agreement to collaborate with the goal of bringing innovative formulations of medicines for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS to people living with HIV in developing countries on an affordable yet sustainable basis.

CHAI and ViiV Healthcare worked together to identify a generic partner after conducting feasibility research. Following this initial joint work ViiV Healthcare submitted necessary documentation to the FDA providing a selective waiver letter for the five-year period of New Chemical Entity (NCE) exclusivity that would have otherwise prevented FDA review and Tentative Approval of Aurobindo Pharma's ANDA at this time.

Dr. Dominique Limet CEO ViiV Healthcare said: 'This first ANDA for a generic dolutegravir confirms that our strong commitment to thinking and acting differently to pursue new ways to expand access to our medicines for people living with HIV in countries where the need is most pressing is working.'

David Ripin PhD Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer CHAI said: 'UNAIDS has set global public health goals calling for 90 percent of those who are HIV-positive to know their status 90 percent of those identified to be linked to treatment programs and 90 percent of those in treatment to achieve undetectable viral load. To tackle these complex challenges targeted efforts to facilitate access to HIV treatment medicines such as dolutegravir are needed.'

Mr. N. Govindarajan Managing Director Aurobindo Pharma said: 'We are pleased to be part of this innovative partnership designed to accelerate access to medicines for treating HIV. Aurobindo Pharma is committed to HIV care and aims to achieve the goals of wider access to HIV treatment care and support; seeking to address the spread of HIV through development of this newer class of drugs and fixed-dose combinations for low- and middle-income countries. '

The filing by Aurobindo Pharma is the second result of the agreement between CHAI and ViiV Healthcare and comes less than six months after another generic manufacturer announced that it had received Tentative Approval from the FDA for paediatric formulations of another ViiV Healthcare antiretroviral (also under PEPFAR for sale in licensed countries outside of the United States) through innovative collaboration with ViiV Healthcare and CHAI.

About Clinton Health Access Initiative

The Clinton Health Access Initiative Inc. (CHAI) (http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org) was founded in 2002 with a transformational goal: help save the lives of millions of people living with HIV/AIDS in the developing world by dramatically scaling up antiretroviral treatment. When CHAI was founded many viewed this goal as unreasonable because health systems in poor countries were too weak and prices of relevant drugs and diagnostic tests were too high. CHAI played a leadership role working alongside governments and other partners to lower the costs of treatment and help build the in-country systems necessary to provide lifesaving treatment to millions of people. Since then CHAI has pursued several similarly ambitious goals from scaling up pediatric AIDS treatment in order to achieve equity with adults in a timeframe few thought possible to rapidly accelerating the rollout of new vaccines. CHAI has achieved many of its most important successes when seeking to fundamentally change the way the world approaches an issue and pushing the boundaries of what is considered feasible in global health.

""After more than a decade in the lab trying to assess how methylnaltrexone affects cancer, we have the first evidence that it can decrease tumor growth and extend survival in patients who respond to the drug.""

The study was a retrospective survival analysis involving 229 patients across two randomized, controlled clinical trials on the relief of constipation for patients in the late stages of cancer and other terminal diseases.

Opioids like morphine are known to cause severe constipation that often cannot be relieved by traditional laxatives.

""In these two trials, 117 cancer patients received methylnaltrexone (marketed as Relistor) for opioid-induced constipation, while 112 were given a placebo,"" said the study.

Just over half (57 percent) of those who received methylnaltrexone experienced relief from constipation. The other 43 percent did not.

""Those who received and responded to methylnaltrexone lived, on average, twice as long (118 days versus 58 days) as those who did not respond or were given the placebo,"" said the findings.

The drug did not have any life-extending effects on patients with other illnesses like congestive heart failure, advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neurologic diseases.

Researchers are not sure exactly how the drug works to extend life, and are continuing to study the matter.

Methylnaltrexone was invented in 1979 by Leon Goldberg, a pharmacologist at the University of Chicago who wanted to help a friend suffering from cancer and morphine-related constipation.

Moss and his colleagues began to notice in 2002, during early studies using the drug, that some cancer patients lived longer than expected.

""These were patients with advanced cancer and a life expectancy of one to two months yet several lived for another five or six months,"" Moss said.

""It made us wonder: could there possibly be a direct effect on the tumors""

Safety and efficacy of guanfacine extended-release tablets in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age have not been established. Important Safety Information Guanfacine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to guanfacine extended-release tablets or its inactive ingredients, or other products containing guanfacine. Rash and pruritus have been reported.

Treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported. Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies. The sympatholytic action of guanfacine extended-release tablets may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs.

Most common adverse reactions (= 5% and at least twice placebo rate) in clinical trials: somnolence, fatigue, hypotension, nausea, lethargy, abdominal pain, insomnia, dizziness, dry mouth, irritability, vomiting, and bradycardia.

Viagra boosts blood flow in the body while flibanserin, which is being marketed under the name Addyi, is a neurotransmitter drug that affects the central nervous system much like common anti-depression medications. Scientists aren't completely sure why it can increase sexual desire.

Another key difference: its dosage and associated hurdles. To be prescribed flibanserin, a woman must first find a doctor who has received specific training on the drug. She then must locate a pharmacist who has been specially trained to dispense it. Unlike Viagra, flibanserin has to be taken every day, and it can take at least four weeks before a woman notices any change in her level of desire — and another four weeks for the drug to deliver its full effect.

The uncertainties related to taking such a drug might be of real value to women who are diagnosed as having a distressing lack of sexual desire. But several women's health advocates have also been trying to get the word out that the oft-cited statistic that 40 percent of women in America suffer from sexual dysfunction is not accurate. This statistic came from a study with dubious methodology that was financed by Pfizer, the maker of Viagra. Health advocates say that other factors are more often at issue.

Women's lack of lust may be most often attributed to any number of factors, including stress, fatigue, recent childbirth, drug or alcohol use, relationship satisfaction, boredom in the bedroom and emotional or psychological disorders.

“Every woman really needs a thorough assessment,"" Lori Brotto, an expert on hypoactive sexual-desire disorder, told NPR's “On the Media"" back in August when Sprout Pharmaceuticals, the maker of Addyi, got FDA approval. “By and large, most of the studies [about female sexual dysfunction] have pointed to psychosocial, interpersonal, individual factors. ... Women with low desire have three times the rate of depression compared to women with healthy levels of sexual desire.""

But the big issue that doesn't get enough attention is Addyi's serious effects when combined with alcohol — in particular, severe low blood pressure that could lead to loss of consciousness.

Jen Gunter, a California-based obstetrician-gynecologist, took the “training"" to be able to prescribe Addyi. She recounted on her blog that it consisted of reading 12 PowerPoint slides that boiled down to: “Don't mix Addyi with alcohol. Your patient must promise to not drink alcohol ever on Addyi. You know this medication is dangerous if mixed with alcohol? It is your responsibility to make sure your patient doesn't mix this medication with alcohol.""

It's been widely reported that the testing for the safety of flibanserin with alcohol was conducted on 23 men and two women — this for a drug designed only for women. The study took place in the early morning, and researchers found that some of the women couldn't handle drinking the equivalent of a half to a full bottle of alcohol on an empty stomach within 10 minutes of waking.

Yet alcohol beverage sales are a $174 billion business in the United States. And the pushing of wine, high-octane fruity mixed drinks and low-cal beer on women is a big growth market for beverage distributors as well as for restaurants and bars.

Some 5.8 million women in the U.S. are estimated to have an alcohol-use disorder, and alcohol-related deaths are the third-leading preventable cause of death in the U.S., taking the lives of approximately 26,000 women annually.

Junk science says that drinking one glass of red wine has the equivalent benefit to your well-being as an hour at the gym, and social media glorify this factoid along with seemingly endless memes about women's obsession with wine at the end of the day, with friends or during a romantic date.

But be forewarned: Our society's ease with turning life's travails over to pretty little pills and a drink will not end happily.

Gray, MD, director of endovascular services, at Columbia University Hospital, is providing study leadership as the national principal investigator.

The TOBA II study is designed to enroll 210 subjects at 30-40 sites in the United States and Europe. All study subjects need to be suffering from advanced peripheral artery disease in one or both legs.

They will be treated with the Tack Endovascular System following standard balloon angioplasty or drug-coated balloon angioplasty in the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries when a dissection (a tear in the artery wall) occurs (seewwwBA-II.comfor details).

The Tack Endovascular System is a new technology designed to repair dissections that frequently occur as a complication of balloon angioplasty. Published literature reports up to 88%1of angioplasty procedures have dissections.

Earlier this year, promising 12-month results from the company’s European TOBA study were presented2at a major vascular conference in Germany and demonstrated the potential of the Tack implant for improving arterial healing following angioplasty.

The system allows physicians to repair dissections while leaving a minimal amount of foreign material in the artery, reducing mechanical stress on the artery, and preserving future treatment options.

Intact Vascular is a privately held medical device company that develops minimally invasive peripheral vascular products. The Tack Endovascular System is designed to optimize peripheral balloon angioplasty results in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease.

Data from the Extreme and High Risk Studies in the CoreValve U.S. Pivotal Trial demonstrated that the CoreValve System is safe and effective with high rates of survival and some of the lowest rates of stroke and valve leakage reported. The CoreValve System, with a supra-annular valve design, has also achieved hemodynamics, or blood flow, post-implant with results similar to the gold standard, surgical valves.

The Medtronic CoreValve Japan Trial confirmed the performance of CoreValve shown in the U.S. Pivotal Trial. At 6 months, 91.7 percent of the transfemoral (TAVI procedure through the femoral artery) patients in the Japan trial met the primary endpoint of improvement of at least one New York Heart Association class (measures severity of heart failure symptoms) and aortic valve area (measures the severity of aortic stenosis) greater than 1.2 cm2. For all patients in the trial, freedom from all-cause mortality at 6 months was 90.8 percent. The trial also demonstrated functional and anatomical effectiveness of CoreValve.

The CoreValve self-expanding nitinol frame enables physicians to deliver the device to the diseased valve in a controlled manner, allowing for accurate placement. Valves are delivered via the smallest (18Fr, or approximately 1/4 inch) TAVR delivery system available, making it possible to treat patients with difficult or small vasculature.

“Medtronic has been committed to bringing this life-saving therapy to patients in Japan. The feedback from heart teams around the world using CoreValve has been overwhelmingly positive and we are confident that Japanese physicians will embrace the therapy,” said Rhonda Robb, vice president and general manager of the Heart Valve Therapies business, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. “We look forward to working with Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to gain reimbursement for CoreValve, and to initiating comprehensive training and education programs to support heart teams so that more patients may benefit from this break-through technology.”

Since receiving CE (Conformite Europeenne) Mark in 2007, the CoreValve System has been implanted in more than 75,000 patients in more than 60 countries. The CoreValve System was approved by the FDA for patients at extreme risk in January 2014, and approved for high risk patients in June 2014. The next-generation recapturable CoreValve Evolut R transcatheter valve and the CoreValve EnVeo R Delivery Catheter System are available in Europe and other countries that recognize the CE mark.

In collaboration with leading clinicians, researchers and scientists worldwide, Medtronic offers the broadest range of innovative medical technology for the interventional and surgical treatment of cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias. The company strives to offer products and services that deliver clinical and economic value to healthcare consumers and providers around the world.

The CoreValve self-expanding nitinol frame enables physicians to deliver the device to the diseased valve in a controlled manner, allowing for accurate placement. Valves are delivered via the smallest (18Fr, or approximately 1/4 inch) TAVR delivery system available, making it possible to treat patients with difficult or small vasculature.

“Medtronic has been committed to bringing this life-saving therapy to patients in Japan. The feedback from heart teams around the world using CoreValve has been overwhelmingly positive and we are confident that Japanese physicians will embrace the therapy,” said Rhonda Robb, vice president and general manager of the Heart Valve Therapies business, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. “We look forward to working with Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to gain reimbursement for CoreValve, and to initiating comprehensive training and education programs to support heart teams so that more patients may benefit from this break-through technology.”

Since receiving CE (Conformite Europeenne) Mark in 2007, the CoreValve System has been implanted in more than 75,000 patients in more than 60 countries. The CoreValve System was approved by the FDA for patients at extreme risk in January 2014, and approved for high risk patients in June 2014. The next-generation recapturable CoreValve Evolut R transcatheter valve and the CoreValve EnVeo R Delivery Catheter System are available in Europe and other countries that recognize the CE mark.

In collaboration with leading clinicians, researchers and scientists worldwide, Medtronic offers the broadest range of innovative medical technology for the interventional and surgical treatment of cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias. The company strives to offer products and services that deliver clinical and economic value to healthcare consumers and providers around the world.

IBM Watson Health Attracts Start-Ups and Established Leaders

IBM Watson Health has achieved significant market momentum since it was introduced five months ago. Hundreds of partners, ecosystem members and customers are working with IBM to address unmet needs across the continuum of life sciences and healthcare. New collaborations announced today include:

Boston Children’s Hospital has been named Watson Health’s foundational pediatrics partner, building on an existing relationship between the two entities. IBM will integrate Watson’s deep and iterative question and answer capability to enhance and scale the OPENPediatrics initiative, a ground-breaking BCH initiative which aims to bring life-saving medical knowledge to pediatric caregivers worldwide. Moving forward, BCH and IBM will jointly develop solutions for commercialization, initially pursuing applications in personalized medicine, heart health and critical care with the potential to leverage Watson Genomic Analytics to assist researchers and clinicians in the treatment of rare pediatric disease; apply Watson’s image analytics capabilities with the intent to help clinicians improve diagnoses for children facing heart heath conditions; and apply streaming analytics to data from patients on ventilation systems, with the intent to help to medical professionals predict patient decline before it occurs.

Columbia University Medical Center’s departments of Pathology & Cell Biology and Systems Biology will collaborate with IBM to test using IBM Watson to help oncologists in the Columbia Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center translate DNA insights into personalized treatment options for patients.

IBM Watson Health Attracts Start-Ups and Established Leaders

IBM Watson Health has achieved significant market momentum since it was introduced five months ago. Hundreds of partners, ecosystem members and customers are working with IBM to address unmet needs across the continuum of life sciences and healthcare. New collaborations announced today include:

Boston Children’s Hospital has been named Watson Health’s foundational pediatrics partner, building on an existing relationship between the two entities. IBM will integrate Watson’s deep and iterative question and answer capability to enhance and scale the OPENPediatrics initiative, a ground-breaking BCH initiative which aims to bring life-saving medical knowledge to pediatric caregivers worldwide. Moving forward, BCH and IBM will jointly develop solutions for commercialization, initially pursuing applications in personalized medicine, heart health and critical care with the potential to leverage Watson Genomic Analytics to assist researchers and clinicians in the treatment of rare pediatric disease; apply Watson’s image analytics capabilities with the intent to help clinicians improve diagnoses for children facing heart heath conditions; and apply streaming analytics to data from patients on ventilation systems, with the intent to help to medical professionals predict patient decline before it occurs.

Columbia University Medical Center’s departments of Pathology & Cell Biology and Systems Biology will collaborate with IBM to test using IBM Watson to help oncologists in the Columbia Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center translate DNA insights into personalized treatment options for patients. Columbia is the 16th cancer center to test the use Watson Genomic Analytics to bring precision medicine to patients worldwide. As Columbia and other institutions evaluate Watson’s ability to help clinicians in identifying actionable mutations in cancer, Watson’s rationale and insights will continually improve, providing the latest combined wisdom of the world’s leading cancer institutes in a scalable, cloud-based solution.

ICON plc is the first global clinical research organization (CRO) to apply Watson to clinical trial matching, tapping into data in the IBM Watson Health Cloud to help its biomedical customers accelerate medical research and the development of new treatment options for patients. It is estimated that 80 percent of clinical trials fail or are delayed due to inadequate patient enrollment and only 2 percent of eligible patients become trial subjects. ICON will leverage Watson to automate the cumbersome process of identifying patients who meet the criteria for a clinical trial. Watson will also analyze trial protocols against a massive volume of patient data in the Watson Health Cloud to assess trial feasibility and identify optimal trial sites.

Sage Bionetworks’ Open Biomedical Research Platform will be powered by the IBM Watson Health Cloud, with the intent to make the IBM Watson Health Cloud the platform of choice for Sage to aggregate, store, curate, and analyze data collected via apps using ResearchKit. Sage currently has active ResearchKit projects in breast cancer and Parkinson’s Disease. Further, Sage and IBM will collaborate to integrate the IBM Watson Health Cloud with Sage’s BRIDGE server and Synapse, an informatics platform dedicated to supporting the large-scale pooling of data, knowledge, and expertise across institutions to solve some of the most challenging problems in biomedical research. Sage endeavors to engage patients in the scientific discovery process and facilitate global collaboration among researchers working toward a shared goal of advancing and accelerating medical research.

“Successful biomedical research requires active participation and data sharing across a wide variety of stakeholders,” said Stephen H. Friend, MD, PhD, president, co-founder and director, Sage Bionetworks. “The IBM Watson Health Cloud can help us break down barriers that hamper progress in research and accelerate discovery through open collaboration by providing broadly accessible storage with large capacity.”

Teva Pharmaceuticals announced that IBM Watson Health Cloud will serve as Teva’s global technology platform of choice to build solutions designed to help millions of individuals worldwide with complex and chronic conditions such as asthma, pain, and neurodegenerative diseases. Teva expects to introduce its first e-health solution in 2016.

IBM Watson Health Global Headquarters Established in Cambridge Life Science Hub

Unveiled today, Watson Health’s global headquarters are located at 75 Binney Street in Cambridge’s Kendall Square and will serve as a home base for more than 700 IBM employees.

For entrepreneurs and start-ups, Watson Health’s Cambridge headquarters will provide technology, tools and talent to create and launch new products and businesses based on Watson’s cloud-delivered cognitive intelligence. IBM intends to open an interactive Watson Health Experience Center in Cambridge, which will serve as a place for IBM clients to undertake immersive leaning about Watson and how it can help transform their businesses. In addition, IBM Research will establish a dedicated Health Research lab at the headquarters, deepening IBMs decades-long commitment to investigation that informs new IBM offerings.

Cambridge is widely considered the epicenter of the Life Sciences industry, and Massachusetts boasts more than 600 life sciences companies and research organizations employing roughly 60,000 people with a combined payroll topping $7 billion annually, according to the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council. In recent years, Massachusetts has drawn more than 20 percent of all venture capital outlays for biotechnology companies nationally and the majority of grants from the National Institutes of Health.

IBM Watson: Pioneering a New Era of Computing

Watson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015, the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit will help improve the ability of doctors, researchers and insurers to innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created daily. The Watson Health Cloud allows this information to be de-identified, shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data.

The association between number of these MetS-like components and prostate cancer risk and low-grade (Gleason sum < 7) or high-grade (Gleason sum > 7) vs no prostate cancer was evaluated using logistic regression.

Two (P = 0.69) or three to four (P = 0.15) MetS-like components were not significantly related to prostate cancer.

No. 11/570,983, filed Jun. 23, 2005, and incorporated by reference in its entirety herein) has the structure of Formula I:

""##STR00001## The compound of Formula I is a protein kinase inhibitor and is useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases mediated by protein kinases. In particular, the compound of Formula I inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, KDR, HER1, HER2, Bcr-Abl, Tie2, and Ret kinases. It is therefore useful in the treatment of cancers including AML, melanocytic neoplasia, breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer (especially small-cell lung cancer), cancer of the prostate or Kaposi's sarcoma.

""It is well known that the crystalline form of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of a particular drug is often an important determinant of the drug's ease of preparation, hygroscopicity, stability, solubility, storage stability, ease of formulation, rate of dissolution in gastrointestinal fluids and in vivo bioavailability. Crystalline forms occur where the same composition of matter crystallizes in a different lattice arrangement resulting in different thermodynamic properties and stabilities specific to the particular crystalline form. Crystalline forms may also include different hydrates or solvates of the same compound. In deciding which form is preferable, the numerous properties of the forms are compared and the preferred form chosen based on the many physical property variables. It is entirely possible that one form can be preferable in some circumstances where certain aspects such as ease of preparation, stability, etc. are deemed to be critical. In other situations, a different form may be preferred for greater dissolution rate and/or superior bioavailability. It is not yet possible to predict whether a particular compound or salt of a compound will form polymorphs, whether any such polymorphs will be suitable for commercial use in a therapeutic composition, or which polymorphs will display such desirable properties.""

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""There are provided herein crystal and amorphous forms of the compound of Formula I, compositions including the crystal and amorphous forms, and methods of preparing the crystal and amorphous forms and compositions. The present technology further provides methods of using the crystal or amorphous forms of compounds of Formula I and compositions thereof to treat various diseases, including but not limited to, those that can be prevented, inhibited or ameliorated by inhibition of kinase activity selected from FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, KDR, HER1, HER2, Bcr-Abl, Tie2, and Ret kinases.""

No. 11/570,983, filed Jun. 23, 2005, and incorporated by reference in its entirety herein) has the structure of Formula I:

""##STR00001## The compound of Formula I is a protein kinase inhibitor and is useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases mediated by protein kinases. In particular, the compound of Formula I inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, KDR, HER1, HER2, Bcr-Abl, Tie2, and Ret kinases. It is therefore useful in the treatment of cancers including AML, melanocytic neoplasia, breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer (especially small-cell lung cancer), cancer of the prostate or Kaposi's sarcoma.

""It is well known that the crystalline form of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of a particular drug is often an important determinant of the drug's ease of preparation, hygroscopicity, stability, solubility, storage stability, ease of formulation, rate of dissolution in gastrointestinal fluids and in vivo bioavailability. Crystalline forms occur where the same composition of matter crystallizes in a different lattice arrangement resulting in different thermodynamic properties and stabilities specific to the particular crystalline form. Crystalline forms may also include different hydrates or solvates of the same compound. In deciding which form is preferable, the numerous properties of the forms are compared and the preferred form chosen based on the many physical property variables. It is entirely possible that one form can be preferable in some circumstances where certain aspects such as ease of preparation, stability, etc. are deemed to be critical. In other situations, a different form may be preferred for greater dissolution rate and/or superior bioavailability. It is not yet possible to predict whether a particular compound or salt of a compound will form polymorphs, whether any such polymorphs will be suitable for commercial use in a therapeutic composition, or which polymorphs will display such desirable properties.""

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""There are provided herein crystal and amorphous forms of the compound of Formula I, compositions including the crystal and amorphous forms, and methods of preparing the crystal and amorphous forms and compositions. The present technology further provides methods of using the crystal or amorphous forms of compounds of Formula I and compositions thereof to treat various diseases, including but not limited to, those that can be prevented, inhibited or ameliorated by inhibition of kinase activity selected from FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, KDR, HER1, HER2, Bcr-Abl, Tie2, and Ret kinases.""

His doctor decided to do a full work-up, and eventually diagnosed with Berger's disease, which causes inflammation of the kidneys and can lead to organ failure.

""It was by far the most crushing day of my life,"" Reseska said. ""I would drive by that dialysis center at Danbury Hospital, and that was heavy on my heart because I thought, 'One day I'm going to end up there.' ""

But 30 years later, Reseska, who lives in Newtown with his wife and two children, is happy, healthy and able to continue working at his sales job. Thanks to two kidney transplants, he has managed to avoid dialysis.

Not everyone is so lucky. Each day, 12 people die waiting for a kidney.

Of the 123,000 Americans on the waiting list for an organ transplant, more than 101,000 need a kidney. Only 17,000 people each year are able to get one.

In Connecticut, roughly 1,250 people are waiting for a kidney, according to the National Kidney Association and the United Network of Organ Sharing.

The waiting list is long for several reasons. First, many Americans suffer from kidney disease, which can result from a variety of common conditions including diabetes and high blood pressure. Also, the number of people opting to donate organs after they die is not growing, and the number willing and able to donate while they are alive is very small.

Chris Reseska's kidneys started to fail for the first time about 20 years ago. Everyone in his family was tested as a possible donor. His younger brother, Mike, turned out to be the best match.

Mike Reseska had his hesitations about the procedure, but said a surgeon at Yale-New Haven Hospital put his mind at ease. The surgeon told him, ""You can still have your glass of wine, you can still live your life to its fullest. The other kidney is going to get a little stronger, you'll never know its gone and you're saving your brother's life.""

Reseska donated his kidney to his big brother in January 1998.

About three years ago, however, Chris Reseska started having symptoms suggesting that the donated kidney was failing. He didn't know it at the time, but he was carrying more than 60 pounds of water on his 6-foot-2 frame, a symptom of his worsening condition.

Reseska's sister, Nancy Anderson, got tested, but wasn't a match. They decided to try an organ swap, in which Anderson would donate a kidney to another transplant patient in return for a compatible kidney for Chris from another donor.

But time wasn't on their side.

""I was going south in a big way,"" Reseska said. ""I was absolutely ready to be put on dialysis, and the collapse of my life as I knew it was imminent.""

But then Mike Reseska's wife, Mary Lou, 49, decided to see if she was a match. Because of improved medications, a genetic link is no longer required to ensure a successful transplant.

""We were running out of options,"" she said. ""Chris was really down and out. It was really hard to watch.""

Mary Lou Reseska had blood, urine and radiology tests to determine whether she could donate. After a weekend of waiting, she got the news that she was match, and immediately called her brother-in-law.

""What were the chances that my sister-in-law would be a viable match?"" Reseska said. ""It was a miracle.""

Reseska wasn't the only one relieved, Mary Lou Reseska felt the same way when the hospital called.

""I thought I was a match, and I would have been really disappointed if I wasn't,"" she said. ""So I said, 'Let's go, let's do this.'""

Three weeks later, in adjacent operating rooms at Yale-New Haven, Mary Lou's left kidney was removed and transplanted into her brother-in-law.

The procedure has changed greatly since Mike Reseska donated his kidney. In the past, it involved a long incision and a long hospital stay and recovery.

Now the surgery is less invasive. A short incision, about three inches long, is made above the pubic bone, the same spot as in a C-section, to remove the kidney.

Dr. Richard Formica, director of transplant medicine at Yale-New Haven, said organs transplanted from a living person last longer than those harvested from a dead donor.

Most people who decide to donate organs do so because a family member or loved one is in need. But Formica said there are some people, called ""altruistic donors,"" who donate to perfect strangers.

All donors go through a very thorough screening process to make sure they are healthy enough, both mentally and physically, for the surgery.

""Donor safety comes first and foremost; there is no negotiating on that topic,"" Formica said.","['untogs', 'ylnwhv', 'ylnwhv']",[],Hearst Newspapers,",usct,namz,usa,use,usnew,",NAMZ USA ,"When he was 22, Chris Reseska went to the doctor with a sore throat.

“R & D on cancer prevention and treatment of early-stage cancer is very socially valuable,” the authors told me in an email, “yet our work shows that society provides private firms — perhaps inadvertently — with surprisingly few incentives to conduct this kind of research.”

To secure F.D.A. approval, after patenting a drug, drug companies race the clock to show that their product is safe and effective. The more quickly they can complete those studies, the longer they have until the patent runs out, which is the period of time during which profit margins are highest. Developing drugs to treat late-stage disease is usually much faster than developing drugs to treat early-stage disease or prevention, because late-stage disease is aggressive and progresses rapidly. This allows companies to see results in clinical trials more quickly, even if those results are only small improvements in survival.

This very lesson is taught in some medicinal chemistry textbooks. For instance, one notes that “some compounds are never developed [into drugs] because the patent protected production time available to recoup the cost of development is too short.”

The clinical trials necessary for the F.D.A. to approve drugs for commercialization take years. Though a patent lasts 20 years (before any extensions), a typical drug comes to market with about 12.5 years of patent life remaining. But would-be innovators have some control over the length of time between receipt of a patent and F.D.A. approval — the “commercialization lag.” By studying patients in whom safety and efficacy can be demonstrated more quickly, innovators can reduce this lag. (Recent studies suggest that commercialization lag times may be decreasing for some types of drugs.)

Many more cancer trials focused on treatments for patients with late-stage cancers than for early-stage cancers, according to the study. Between 1973 and 2011, there were about 12,000 trials for relatively later-stage patients with a 90 percent chance of dying in five years. But there were only about 6,000 focused on earlier-stage patients with a 30 percent chance of dying. And there were over 17,000 trials of patients with the lowest chance of survival (those with recurrent cancers) but only 500 for cancer prevention, which confer the longest survival gains. The bias toward studies focused on patients with shorter survival duration is more prevalent among privately financed trials than for publicly financed ones.

Ms. Williams’s study estimated that the commercialization lag’s incentive to invest in drugs of shorter duration benefit led to 890,000 lost life-years among American patients found to have cancer in 2003 alone.

There are several possible ways to address the commercialization lag. One idea, included in legislation working its way through Congress, is to more routinely confer F.D.A. approval based on indications of improved health that can be measured more quickly than survival — so-called surrogate endpoints, like cancerous white blood cell counts and bone marrow characteristics in leukemia studies. These measures are highly correlated with survival, so they are a reliable way to speed up leukemia drug trials.

According to the study’s analysis, this approach can work. For cancer drugs approved based on some types of validated surrogate endpoints, the researchers found no difference in the number of clinical trials by survival rate. This suggests that surrogate endpoints can undo the bias that arises from the commercialization lag. To date, the only privately financed drugs to prevent cancer — the survival benefits of which would not be apparent for many years — have been F.D.A.-approved based on surrogate endpoints.

Use of surrogate endpoints with no known or strong relationship to survival is controversial. For example, the prostate-specific antigen test level — assessed with a blood test — is correlated with the amount of cancer in the prostate but has limited value in predicting prostate cancer survival. So, though they may be lucrative to drug companies, one would have little confidence that drugs approved based on P.S.A. test results would confer survival benefits. A recent systematic review found that most surrogate endpoints examined in cancer drug trials are weakly related to survival. Though most cancer drugs in recent years have been approved on the basis of surrogate endpoints, a majority of them have unknown or no beneficial survival effects.

Another approach is to extend the period of a drug’s market exclusivity to compensate for the commercialization lag. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 already permits a partial extension — a half year for every year in clinical trial, up to a maximum of five additional years. Ms. Williams’s analysis suggests this is the right idea, but that there are still many potential drugs that receive only very short periods of market exclusivity. The Affordable Care Act includes a provision that grants 12 years of market exclusivity beginning from F.D.A. approval — a half year less than the typical 12.5 years remaining on a patent — but it applies only to biologic drugs.

Drug patents incentivize innovation, and F.D.A. approval is a check regarding drug safety and efficacy. The way they work together affects the incentives for research and could reduce something many would view as highly valuable: cancer prevention.

Professor Cooper, Director of the IMB Centre for Superbug Solutions, said bacteria are less likely to become resistant to an antibiotic based on a modified version of their own sugar.

The fog takes the temperature in the tank down to 230 to 250 degrees below zero Fahrenheit -- colder than any natural place on Earth.

The technique is called whole-body cryotherapy, and yes, it may be coming to a spa, sports medicine clinic or wellness center near you.

Depending on whom you talk to, cryotherapy is either the latest fad, boasting a range of yet-to-be proven benefits -- while boosting the interests of a largely unregulated industry -- or, it's a cutting-edge therapy that can genuinely help people such as Toy resume active, normal lives. It has also become de rigueur for a growing number of elite athletes -- LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and, most recently, members of the Green Bay Packers. These pros, as well as celebrities such as Daniel Craig prepping for his latest James Bond outing, use it to reduce the aches and inflammation caused by tough workouts so they can recover quickly, exercise harder and boost performance.

""This is a supercharged ice bath,"" says Landan Laurusaitis, a personal trainer, former college football lineman, and co-founder of the recently opened Performist cryotherapy studio in Palo Alto. ""I've done a lot of ice baths, and they work wonders on your recovery, but it's not pleasant. This only takes three minutes. It basically gives you all the impact of an ice bath in a fraction of the time.""

Laurusaitis adds that hard-driving tech workers have begun to drop in at The Performist, looking for an endorphin rush from a quick chill in the studio's $75,000 tank. That boost, they say, allows them to keep working late into the evening.

Toy was skeptical of the treatment's purported benefits and worried that getting into the tank would be as much of a shock to her system as jumping into the Arctic Ocean.

But, she says, ""I would walk through fire if it would take away the pain.""

As it turned out, her treatment left her feeling briefly chilled, but it was tolerable, as if she stepped outside on a cold winter morning. She also noticed tingling in the areas of her body affected by pain, but the tingling quickly went away -- as did the pain.

""It was amazing,"" she says. ""I felt immediately better.""

She has since returned for about 40 treatments. The downside is that the treatments, ranging from $40 to $65, depending on the package, aren't covered by insurance. While she wishes the therapy were not so expensive, she thinks it's worth it.

The concept of cryotherapy is nothing new. Applying cold packs to injured joints or muscles to reduce blood flow, swelling and inflammation has long been standard practice among medical practitioners. And, as Laurusaitis said, soaking in ice baths after intense exercise is routine among professional and college athletes.

One of Laurusaitis' personal training clients, Mountain View-reared professional volleyball player Diane Copenhagen, 29, recently tried the cryotherapy tank for the first time and liked it much better than a 20- to 30-minute soak in an ice bath. ""This is an easy and fast way to help your body recover and recuperate,"" Copenhagen says.

The first cryotherapy tank was built in Japan for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The treatment spread to Europe in the 1980s and the United States in the past decade. While most users these days are professional and recreational athletes, the treatment also is used to treat symptoms of arthritis, autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders and depression.

Chiropractor Chris Watson, owner of the Peninsula Wellness Centre, also touts cryotherapy's potential for improving skin tone and helping weight loss; a single session reportedly burns anywhere from 500 to 800 calories.

The medical and scientific communities are far more reserved in their assessments, saying liquid nitrogen has been used medically for procedures such as wart removal. But so far, there is little research to show that cryotherapy offers physiological benefits, either for weight loss or for reducing muscle soreness and recovery time for athletic training.

""I remember how oxygen rooms were popping up a few years ago and a lot of athletes were using them, but the studies never really panned out,"" says Michael Fredericson, a professor of orthopedic surgery and expert in sports medicine at Stanford University Medical Center. ""I don't know if cryotherapy will end up the same way, with the therapy getting going commercially before there is really any science behind it. I'm not saying it's bad, but we don't really know.""

Joseph Costello, senior research associate in the department of sport and exercise science at the University of Portsmouth in England and one of the world's leading researchers on cryotherapy, suggests a placebo effect might be in play for some people. If anything, he says, cryotherapy offers benefits similar to cooling off skin and muscle with ice packs or ice baths, which don't cost as much.

And given that cryotherapy exposes people to extreme temperatures, he said it's imperative for more research to be done on its long-term safety.

Indeed, safety concerns arose after a 24-year-old Las Vegas spa employee was found dead in a cryotherapy chamber in October. Reports say she was using the nitrogen-filling machine alone after the center closed and died of asphyxia due to a lack of oxygen.

Cryotherapy is not regulated by the FDA or by most states, including California. The woman's death prompted Nevada health authorities to issue safety guidelines, which recommend that pregnant women or people with certain health conditions -- including high blood pressure or a history of strokes and seizures -- avoid it and that centers make sure employees are properly trained in using the machines.

Watson, of the Wellness Centre, and Stephen Evans, another co-founder of The Performist, say client safety is their No. 1 concern. New clients fill out health questionnaires and have their blood pressure checked, they say. And in contrast to the apparent practices in the Las Vegas case, an employee is always present when someone uses their chambers, they say. Of the about 1,000 people who have visited the Wellness Centre over the past year, Watson says, ""We haven't had one incident.""

To prevent potential frostbite, both centers require people to don thermal socks and gloves to protect feet and hands. They also make sure people don't go in with moist skin. Back in 2011, American sprinter Justin Gatlin said he suffered frostbite while entering a chamber wearing socks sweaty from a previous workout, according to the New York Times.

Concerns about frostbite and inconclusive information on the treatment's athletic benefits made Michael Mendenhall, 53, of Palo Alto, wary at first. But he gave it a try because he wants to compete as a master swimmer and needs to keep up a rigorous training schedule. After a week of daily sessions, he has yet to experience frostbite. Moreover, he's noticed a marked decrease in recovery time from the workouts, from one or two days to several hours. ""I just feel really good, more alert,"" he says.

While Evans agrees that more research needs to be done, he says there's enough evidence to show ""this isn't a quack thing.""

He himself hits the chamber daily to improve his training for marathons and CrossFit competitions.

Depending on whom you talk to, cryotherapy is either the latest fad, boasting a range of yet-to-be proven benefits -- while boosting the interests of a largely unregulated industry -- or, it's a cutting-edge therapy that can genuinely help people such as Toy resume active, normal lives. It has also become de rigueur for a growing number of elite athletes -- LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and, most recently, members of the Green Bay Packers. These pros, as well as celebrities such as Daniel Craig prepping for his latest James Bond outing, use it to reduce the aches and inflammation caused by tough workouts so they can recover quickly, exercise harder and boost performance.

""This is a supercharged ice bath,"" says Landan Laurusaitis, a personal trainer, former college football lineman, and co-founder of the recently opened Performist cryotherapy studio in Palo Alto. ""I've done a lot of ice baths, and they work wonders on your recovery, but it's not pleasant. This only takes three minutes. It basically gives you all the impact of an ice bath in a fraction of the time.""

Laurusaitis adds that hard-driving tech workers have begun to drop in at The Performist, looking for an endorphin rush from a quick chill in the studio's $75,000 tank. That boost, they say, allows them to keep working late into the evening.

Toy was skeptical of the treatment's purported benefits and worried that getting into the tank would be as much of a shock to her system as jumping into the Arctic Ocean.

But, she says, ""I would walk through fire if it would take away the pain.""

While doctors who treat young cancer patients hailed the approval, others expressed concern that prescribing OxyContin to children could put them at risk for addiction.

OxyContin, an extended-release version of the painkiller oxycodone, has gained notoriety in recent years because of its frequent abuse. People addicted to painkillers crush the pills so that they can be snorted or injected, producing a powerful high.

In 2010, Purdue Pharma reformulated OxyContin to make it more difficult to abuse.

The FDA notes that children generally have many fewer options for pain relief than adults. Because of that problem, the FDA asked Purdue to perform studies to see if the drug could be used safely in children, ages 11 to 16, with pain caused by cancer, trauma or major surgery, said Sharon Hertz, a physician with the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in an interview on the agency's website.

The FDA approved OxyContin for children this age who need ""daily, round-the-clock, long-term"" pain relief for which there is no alternative, Hertz said.

""Children are not treated with opioids very often and usually it's only for a limited period of time with close supervision by health care professionals,"" Hertz said. ""Fewer daily doses may free patients for physical therapy appointments, allow them to go home from the hospital sooner and may help them to sleep through the night without waking up.""

Children at the end of life aren't at risk of addiction.

Having additional long-acting painkillers ""is going to be tremendously helpful for treating children with cancer pain or pain at the end of life,"" said Justin Baker, pediatric oncologist and hospice and palliative medicine doctor at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

But prescribing OxyContin to youngsters with short-term medical needs could put them at risk for developing an addiction that haunts them long after they leave the hospital, said Andrew Kolodny, director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. Teens are at higher risk of addiction than adults because the brain doesn't mature until about age 25.

The sympatholytic action of guanfacine extended-release tablets may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs.

Most common adverse reactions (= 5% and at least twice placebo rate) in clinical trials: somnolence, fatigue, hypotension, nausea, lethargy, abdominal pain, insomnia, dizziness, dry mouth, irritability, vomiting, and bradycardia.

Most recently, Mr. Osborne was the Chief Financial Officer at SCYNEXIS, where he led the initial public and a follow-on offering on NASDAQ. Prior experiences include NOBEX, where he raised more than $60 million of venture capital, and International Murex Technologies Co., where he ran the world-wide finance group and which he helped sell to Abbott Laboratories. Mr. Osborne holds a B.S. in Accounting from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

""This is an exciting time to be joining Innocrin as the company initiates Phase 2 castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and breast cancer studies of VT-464,"" said Mr. Osborne. ""I'm excited to help the Innocrin team attain its goal of improving the lives of patients of high unmet medical need."" About VT-464 VT-464 is a once-daily oral therapeutic given without prednisone. VT-464 selectively inhibits CYP17 lyase, a target of abiraterone, and blocks the androgen receptor (AR), the target of enzalutamide. There is a strong and growing body of preclinical and clinical evidence that shows that some abiraterone- or enzalutamide-resistant patients will respond to VT-464 treatment. Resistance to abiraterone, enzalutamide or both represents a major unmet medical need due to the widespread and growing use of these new agents, and their high cross-resistance (e.g., patients who have been treated with either abiraterone or enzlutamide typically do not respond to the other).

VT-464 may also have significant potential for the treatment of breast cancer due to its selective inhibition of CYP17 lyase, which results in the depletion of both androgens and estrogens, in addition to its AR antagonist activity. It is thought that the AR may stimulate disease progression in some patients whose tumors are triple-negative or are ER+ but have become resistant to ER-directed therapies such as aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen. Recent preclinical study results have confirmed that VT-464 more potently blocks the growth of ER+ and/or AR+ breast cancer cells more potently than enzalutamide. About Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer affecting men in the United States: an estimated one in six will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 240,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed and about 30,000 men will die of the disease this year, and that approximately two million men in the U.S. currently count themselves among prostate cancer survivors. About Breast Cancer Each year over 230,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in the United States, with almost 40,000 deaths attributable to the disease. While estrogen deprivation is currently the standard of care for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, the majority of patients eventually develop resistance. Though patients with the ER+/AR+ subtype comprise ~75% of all metastatic BC cases, the most significant unmet need lis the triple-negative subtype, a population that might respond well to anti-androgen therapies as evidenced by recent results from a Phase 2 study using enzalutamide.

Vickers, Ph.D., Head of Research and Development, Shire.

Symptoms of dry eye disease vary by patient, but typically may include eye dryness, overall eye discomfort, stinging, burning, a gritty feeling and episodes of blurred vision.

OPUS-3, a randomized, double-masked, 12-week Phase 3 study enrolled 711 patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast. The clinical trial's primary endpoint is patient-reported symptom improvement as measured by the Eye Dryness Score EDS scale.

The new drug application for lifitegrast included data from four randomized, controlled clinical trials with more than 1,800 patients. These include one Phase 2 study, two Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies (OPUS-1 and OPUS-2), and one long-term Phase 3 safety study (SONATA).

Shire's Commitment to Ophthalmics

In May 2014, Shire established its Ophthalmics Business Unit, solidifying its commitment to growing in this therapeutic area. Shire's multi-faceted approach to discovery, development, and delivery in both rare diseases and specialty conditions includes our efforts to address unmet needs in eye care.

Shire's growth in ophthalmics has been driven by a combination of strategic acquisitions and organic growth. Committed to growing its reputation as a leading biotech company, Shire is focused on continuing to expand its ophthalmics portfolio to include treatment options for rare diseases and those for anterior and posterior eye conditions. In just over two years, acquisitions include Foresight Biotherapeutics, SARcode Bioscience, Premacure AB, and BIKAM Pharmaceuticals, which have helped bolster Shire's early-, mid- and late-stage ophthalmics pipeline. The Company currently has an ophthalmics pipeline of investigational candidates in dry eye disease, retinopathy of prematurity, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and infectious conjunctivitis.

OPUS-3, a randomized, double-masked, 12-week Phase 3 study enrolled 711 patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast. The clinical trial's primary endpoint is patient-reported symptom improvement as measured by the Eye Dryness Score EDS scale.

The new drug application for lifitegrast included data from four randomized, controlled clinical trials with more than 1,800 patients. These include one Phase 2 study, two Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies (OPUS-1 and OPUS-2), and one long-term Phase 3 safety study (SONATA).

Shire's Commitment to Ophthalmics

In May 2014, Shire established its Ophthalmics Business Unit, solidifying its commitment to growing in this therapeutic area. Shire's multi-faceted approach to discovery, development, and delivery in both rare diseases and specialty conditions includes our efforts to address unmet needs in eye care.

Shire's growth in ophthalmics has been driven by a combination of strategic acquisitions and organic growth. Committed to growing its reputation as a leading biotech company, Shire is focused on continuing to expand its ophthalmics portfolio to include treatment options for rare diseases and those for anterior and posterior eye conditions. In just over two years, acquisitions include Foresight Biotherapeutics, SARcode Bioscience, Premacure AB, and BIKAM Pharmaceuticals, which have helped bolster Shire's early-, mid- and late-stage ophthalmics pipeline. The Company currently has an ophthalmics pipeline of investigational candidates in dry eye disease, retinopathy of prematurity, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and infectious conjunctivitis.

""Breastfeeding is known to improve the health and encourage proper growth and development of an infant. Breast milk provides the ideal amount of nutrition for infants with the proper mix of vitamins, protein and fat. Breast milk is known to be digested more easily than formula and can aid in the maturing of the infant's immune system. Breastfeeding is also known to supply an infant with valuable antibodies that can defend against illness. Even further, breastfeeding reduces the incidence of asthma and promotes optional brain development. Studies have shown that breastfed infants have less frequent and shorter episodes of illness. Additionally, the sucking action of the infant aids in dental development as well as development of the infant's facial bones and oral muscles. Conversely, lack of nursing increases the risk of childhood diabetes, cancers, ear infections, obesity and respiratory infections. In other aspects, the skin-to-skin contact encouraged by nursing offer infants emotional security and encourages bonding.

""In yet other aspects, research has shown that nursing also offers health benefits for mothers. Increased levels of oxytocin stimulate uterine contractions, helping the uterus return to a pre-pregnancy size, decreasing blood loss and encouraging uterine toning. Nursing also burns additional calories and increases the rate of weight loss in most nursing mothers. Mothers who nurse their infants have a lower risk of developing osteoporosis and breast, ovarian and uterine cancers. Additionally, nursing allows a mother to feed her infant during times that normal supplies of food and water are not available.

""During feedings, caregivers typically choose to sit in a chair, rocking chair or on a bed and hold the infant in their arms with the head of the infant resting in the elbow region of the arm and the infant's body on the caregiver's lap. Feedings can be performed over 1000 times in the first three months of life alone. Both feeding actions of breast and bottle feeding can result in the caregiver experiencing arm, upper back, shoulder and neck pain and stress and such effects are only worsened by the extended time of feeding. Injury and discomfort due to feeding can result in the caregiver making adjustments that result in improper positioning of the infant, making latching onto the nipple difficult which can, in turn, cause nipple irritation and soreness for a nursing mother. Also, carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis can result from repetitively gripping, lifting and positioning the wrist during feeding.

""In order to receive the most positive outcome from nursing, it is very important for the infant to latch onto the nipple in an optimal position. While nursing, the mother's nipple should be aligned to the month of the infant. Misalignment of the nipple to the infant's mouth often leads to discomfort due to nipple irritation and soreness as well as frustration. It is also important for the caregiver to be appropriately supported to prevent the development of strain and injury.

""In the past, infant feeding pillows have been provided as an aid for feeding an infant. However, these prior art infant feeding pillows typically require the use of the arm of the caregiver to hold the infant's head. Thus, such prior art infant feeding pillows do not prevent strain and injury to the arm and elbow of a caregiver. Some prior art infant feeding pillows are designed to be placed around the waist of a caregiver and, optionally, secured with the use of a fastener. Such a configuration can be bulky and cumbersome as well as fail to accommodate a wide range of body types. Also, prior art infant feeding pillows do not provide adequate support for the caregiver's arm during post-feeding activities such as burping. Even further, such prior art pillows are generally no longer used once an infant no longer requires breast or bottle feeding.

""Thus, there is a need for an infant feeding pillow that enables proper positioning and support of both the infant and caregiver.""

This summary is exemplary and not restrictive, and it is intended to neither identity key or critical elements of the disclosure nor delineate the scope thereof. The sole purpose of this summary is to explain and exemplify certain concepts of the disclosure as an introduction to the following complete and extensive detailed description.

""In one aspect, an infant support pillow comprising a body comprising a main portion and a wedge portion is provided. The main portion of the body can have a top surface, a first side and a longitudinal axis. The lop surface of the main portion can be configured to support at least the arm of a user and, optionally, at least a portion of the head of an infant. The wedge portion can be coupled to and extend from the first side of the main portion in a plane transverse to the longitudinal axis of the main portion. A width of the wedge portion can decrease front a base portion to a tip portion as the distance from the first side of the main body increases.

If it did, they can stay on an experimental drug that otherwise would not be available to them. If it did not, they can try something else, months sooner than they normally would find out that a drug had failed to help.

“They don’t lose any time,” said Dr. Nader Sanai, the doctor leading the study at Phoenix’s Barrow Neurological Institute.

Time is everything for people with glioblastoma, the most common and deadly type of brain tumor, the kind that killed Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in 2009. Even when surgeons think they got it all, the cancer usually grows back and proves fatal. The few drugs to treat these tumors have little effect — median survival is about 14 months.

“We’ve had an endless string of failures” to find better ones, Sanai said.

His study is for people whose cancer came back. Doctors use a stored sample from the original tumor to see if its growth is driven by any genes or pathways targeted by one of the experimental drugs in development. If so, they give that single dose of the new drug before surgery to remove the new tumor.

Then, the tumor tissue is examined under a microscope to see if the drug had its intended effect on the genes or pathways.

So far, the study has tested one drug from AstraZeneca PLC in four patients. Another drug, from Novartis, will be added soon.

“We’re trying to develop a portfolio of these” so there are many possible drugs available for new patients under a single “umbrella” study, Sanai said.

It is called a “phase zero” clinical trial because it comes before the usual three-phase experiments to determine a drug’s safety, ideal dose and effectiveness.

“We view this as a great thing, as something that will produce better drugs that have a greater chance of working,” said Dr. Richard Pazdur, cancer drug chief at the FDA.

“Cost potentially will go down and certainly time will go down” for companies testing new drugs this way and patients seeking something that will help, he said.

Finding treatments for brain tumors is “a huge unmet medical need” that justifies trying a new approach, Pazdur said.

Dr. James Doroshow was involved in the only previous studies like this, done at the National Cancer Institute.

In the past, “if you had a new drug, you’d give it to a patient, you’d measure the blood levels, but very rarely would you have a way to know whether the presumed method of action was working in the patient,” he said.

The Arizona study gives a way to check that, because the tumor is removed right after the first dose is given. And if the drug does not work in any or few of the people who get it, the study could spare others a futile treatment, and limit the time and money a drug company invests.

“If you’re going to fail, you want to fail early and fail fast before you put thousands of patients into randomized trials,” Doroshow said.

The experimental drug did not appear to help Simons, a 55-year-old former pharmacist from Gold Canyon, an hour’s drive east of Phoenix. Doctors decided to try an older drug, Temodar, after her surgery in late October.

“The real interest in these kind of trials is not necessarily putting patients on these drugs but keeping them off drugs that aren’t going to work,” said Sanai, who treated Simons.

Initial sales effort of SciBase’s product Nevisense will focus on the private dermatologists in Austria.

“We specialize in finding new innovative technologies that improve health care for both patients and physicians. Skin cancer is a growing global health problem and during our evaluation of Nevisense we received excellent feedback about the instrument from the dermatologists we talked to. Nevisense is a perfect fit for us and is complementary to our existing product range”, says Manfred Schartner, CEO at Intramed.

Approximately 40 percent of Austria’s dermatologists are active in the private health sector, which is the primary target group in the first phase of marketing Nevisense. [1]

“This agreement takes us one step further in our global expansion and commercialization. In Austria we are focusing on establishing our method among private dermatologists first as the public sector usually takes longer to adopt new technologies. We see good potential and interest for Nevisense in Austria”, says Simon Grant, CEO at SciBase.

Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, accounting for nearly half of all cancers. It has been estimated that nearly half of all Americans who live to age 65 will develop skin cancer at least once. Malignant melanoma is the most fatal form of skin cancer causing the majority (75%) of deaths related to skin cancer. Worldwide, doctors diagnose about 230,000 new cases of melanoma yearly. The key to management is early detection, which is a challenge due to lack of objective tools for diagnosis, a problem that Nevisense addresses.

Intramed is based in Vienna but covers all of Austria. They are one of Austria’s leading distributors of innovative health care equipment.

Initial sales effort of SciBase’s product Nevisense will focus on the private dermatologists in Austria.

“We specialize in finding new innovative technologies that improve health care for both patients and physicians. Skin cancer is a growing global health problem and during our evaluation of Nevisense we received excellent feedback about the instrument from the dermatologists we talked to. Nevisense is a perfect fit for us and is complementary to our existing product range”, says Manfred Schartner, CEO at Intramed.

Approximately 40 percent of Austria’s dermatologists are active in the private health sector, which is the primary target group in the first phase of marketing Nevisense. [1]

“This agreement takes us one step further in our global expansion and commercialization. In Austria we are focusing on establishing our method among private dermatologists first as the public sector usually takes longer to adopt new technologies. We see good potential and interest for Nevisense in Austria”, says Simon Grant, CEO at SciBase.

Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, accounting for nearly half of all cancers. It has been estimated that nearly half of all Americans who live to age 65 will develop skin cancer at least once. Malignant melanoma is the most fatal form of skin cancer causing the majority (75%) of deaths related to skin cancer. Worldwide, doctors diagnose about 230,000 new cases of melanoma yearly. The key to management is early detection, which is a challenge due to lack of objective tools for diagnosis, a problem that Nevisense addresses.

Intramed is based in Vienna but covers all of Austria. They are one of Austria’s leading distributors of innovative health care equipment.

About SciBase and Nevisense

SciBase AB is a Swedish medical technology company, headquartered in Stockholm, that has developed a unique point-of-care device for the accurate detection of malignant melanoma. Its product, Nevisense, helps doctors to detect malignant melanoma, the most dangerous type of skin cancer. SciBase was founded by Stig Ollmar, Associate Professor at The Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. Nevisense is based on substantial research and has achieved excellent results in the largest clinical study ever conducted on the detection of malignant melanoma. Nevisense is CE marked in Europe, has TGA approval in Australia, and is awaiting FDA clearance in the United States. Nevisense is based on a technology called Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), which uses the varying electrical properties of human tissue to categorize cellular structures and thereby detect malignancies. Further is available on www.scibase.com.

The MANTA devices were deployed in less than one minute, without pain or discomfort for the patients. None of the patients experienced any complications associated with the device.  

MANTA closes femoral arterial punctures made during cardiac catheterization procedures such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), ventricular assist (VAD), and balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV). These procedures are the fastest growing segment of the cardiovascular market but the growth is limited by the lack of a safe and reliable large-bore percutaneous closure device. MANTA was purposely designed to address the complexities of closing large holes in high-pressure vessels utilizing novel closure technology. MANTA's fail-safe deployment closes large punctures in less than 60 seconds, providing immediate hemostasis in order to reduce complications associated with large bore closure. The potential worldwide market for large bore vascular closure device exceeds $650 million.

Cases were conducted by Nicholas Van Mieghem, MD, PhD, Medical Director of the Department of Interventional Cardiology at the Thoraxcenter, Erasmus Medical Center, who commented that MANTA, ""is a revolutionary device that will transform how we close cases,"" and Antonio Colombo, MD, Director of the Invasive Cardiology Department at San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Columbus Hospital, who commented that the MANTA device ""is a nice step [toward] making large bore closure a simple and reliable procedure.""

Closure of large bore femoral access sites has been associated with significant morbidity including long time to achieve hemostasis, extended OR time, need for a vascular surgeon in the catheterization lab, delayed ambulation, higher rate of complications and higher total cost of care. Dr. Gary Roubin, MD, PhD, Essential Medical CMO, commented on this most recent experience; ""The deployment of the devices was flawless, and both clinicians found the MANTA to be intuitive, easy-to-use and efficacious. Including our First-in-man studies, we have now enrolled 19 patients to date with rapid hemostasis and no major complications.  We look forward to enrolling other centers in Hamburg and Vancouver shortly.""

In other recent news, the Company has now enrolled 23 patients to date in a post-market-follow-up study (PMFU) in Germany utilizing its X-Seal™ small-bore closure device. This study is a 50-patient PMFU study as a requirement for X-Seal CE Mark approval. Commercialization of X-Seal is expected through a strategic partner once the PMFU study is completed.

About MCNA 

MCNA is a biologic therapy developed to provide high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients who are refractory to or relapsing from first line therapy with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), with a therapeutic alternative to surgery. MCNA is derived from the cell wall fractionation of a non-pathogenic bacteria.  Its activity is believed to be through a dual mechanism of immune stimulation and direct anti-cancer effects. MCNA was developed to be delivered as a sterile suspension for intravesical administration by urologists and urology nurses, following the same dosing paradigm as first line BCG therapy, with the advantage that it can be prepared, handled and disposed of easily and safely. The efficacy, duration of response and safety data from MCNA's pivotal Phase 3 trial was recently published in The Journal of Urology.  The FDA has set February 27, 2016 as its review goal date for MCNA's potential approval.

Commenting on this appointment, Dr. Michael Berendt, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientist declared ""I am very pleased to announce this strategic appointment today.  Brian's engagement as Chief Commercial Officer and his addition to our senior management team is a significant advance in our preparation for the commercial launch of MCNA in the United States.  His unique experience in launch preparation, commercial operations and urology/uro-oncology will permit us to ensure a successful product launch for MCNA which could become the first new therapeutic for the treatment of high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients in decades.""

About MCNA 

MCNA is a biologic therapy developed to provide high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients who are refractory to or relapsing from first line therapy with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), with a therapeutic alternative to surgery. MCNA is derived from the cell wall fractionation of a non-pathogenic bacteria.  Its activity is believed to be through a dual mechanism of immune stimulation and direct anti-cancer effects. MCNA was developed to be delivered as a sterile suspension for intravesical administration by urologists and urology nurses, following the same dosing paradigm as first line BCG therapy, with the advantage that it can be prepared, handled and disposed of easily and safely. The efficacy, duration of response and safety data from MCNA's pivotal Phase 3 trial was recently published in The Journal of Urology.  The FDA has set February 27, 2016 as its review goal date for MCNA's potential approval.

The Taper DPI technology was designed to efficiently deliver dry powder by utilizing a carrier tape. Adamis intends to use the Taper DPI initially to develop a combination drug product, referred to as APC-5000 DPI, intended for the treatment of asthma and COPD by delivering the same active ingredients as GlaxoSmithKline's (""GSK"") Advair Diskus(R). The Advair Diskus(R), which, according to GSK's public filings, had revenues of over $8 billion worldwide in 2013, is a dry powder inhaler product that combines fluticasone and salmeterol. Fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids or steroids which produce anti-inflammatory effects. Salmeterol is a long-acting beta-agonist drug that causes bronchodilation by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airway.

In its current stage of development, Adamis' Taper DPI combines patient-friendly design and active aerosolization to provide effective delivery of drug in a multi-dose DPI. Additional advantages of the current technology seem to include: greater efficiency, ability to supply a single or combination of drugs, eliminates the need for excipients in most formulations, less dependence on the individual's inspiratory flow rate, and ease of use.

Upon completion of clinical trials and if required regulatory approvals are obtained, Adamis intends to commercially market the APC-5000 product to compete for a share of the Advair Diskus(R) market with a branded generic version. Assuming clinical trials are successfully completed, Adamis expects to pursue an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) to seek approval for sale in the U.S. market. Outside of the U.S., the Company plans to identify potential opportunities to market APC-5000 DPI based products. The Company also believes that the device can be used to deliver a variety of different drug compounds, potentially creating multiple follow-on products for Adamis using this platform DPI technology.

Additionally, patients without bilateral middle ear effusion on the day of surgery will be included in the study. The observation period will be extended to two months post-surgery, and a questionnaire will be administered to assess caregiver burden for those patients who require treatment with antibiotic ear drops.

""This study will provide important information regarding the types of patients undergoing tympanostomy tube placement surgery that could potentially benefit from treatment with OTIPRIO administered as a single dose in each ear by the physician during surgery,"" said David A. Weber, Ph.D., president and CEO of Otonomy. ""This is also the first study to evaluate caregiver burden associated with multi-dose, multi-day antibiotic ear drops which will be assessed in a subset of study patients who require ear drop administration.""

The two-month, prospective, multicenter, open-label Phase 3b clinical trial is expected to enroll approximately 500 patients, ages 6 months to 17 years old, in the United States. The clinical effect of OTIPRIO will be measured through assessment of the presence of otorrhea, or drainage from the tube. Safety will be assessed through adverse event reporting and otoscopic examinations. Patients will receive a single administration of OTIPRIO in each ear during surgery.

About OTIPRIO(TM)

OTIPRIO(TM) is a sustained-exposure formulation of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin in development for the treatment of middle ear effusion in pediatric patients undergoing tympanostomy tube placement (TTP) surgery. OTIPRIO has been formulated to provide sustained-exposure of ciprofloxacin so that a single administration provides a full course of treatment. There are approximately one million TTP surgeries performed each year in the United States, and antibiotic ear drops are used in nearly all cases. Despite their routine use, no antibiotic ear drop has received FDA approval for this indication. Moreover, current ear drop products require multi-dose, multi-day regimens for efficacy. Full compliance with these regimens can be challenging, and missed antibiotic doses can compromise efficacy and increase the potential for bacterial resistance.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has assigned a PDUFA action date of December 25, 2015 for the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for OTIPRIO for the treatment of middle ear effusion in pediatric patients undergoing TTP surgery. If approved within the standard review period, Otonomy anticipates a commercial launch for OTIPRIO in the United States in the first quarter of 2016. OTIPRIO is also being evaluated for two potential label expansion indications: a Phase 2 feasibility trial has been completed in pediatric patients with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT), and a Phase 2 feasibility trial is ongoing for patients with otitis externa (swimmer's ear).

About Otonomy

Otonomy is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for diseases and disorders of the ear. Otonomy's proprietary technology provides sustained exposure of drugs to the ear following a single administration. Otonomy has three product candidates in development. OTIPRIO(TM) is an antibiotic that has completed Phase 3 clinical trials in pediatric patients with middle ear effusion at the time of tympanostomy tube placement surgery, and the FDA has assigned a PDUFA action date of December 25, 2015 for Otonomy's New Drug Application. OTO-104 is a steroid that has completed a Phase 2b clinical trial in 154 patients with Ménière's disease. Based on these results, Otonomy intends to initiate two parallel Phase 3 trials for OTO-104 in Ménière's disease patients with at least one trial initiated by the end of 2015. OTO-311 is an NMDA receptor antagonist in development as a treatment for tinnitus. A Phase 1 clinical safety trial for OTO-311 is expected to begin before the end of 2015.

The clinical effect of OTIPRIO will be measured through assessment of the presence of otorrhea, or drainage from the tube. Safety will be assessed through adverse event reporting and otoscopic examinations. Patients will receive a single administration of OTIPRIO in each ear during surgery.

About OTIPRIO(TM)

OTIPRIO(TM) is a sustained-exposure formulation of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin in development for the treatment of middle ear effusion in pediatric patients undergoing tympanostomy tube placement (TTP) surgery. OTIPRIO has been formulated to provide sustained-exposure of ciprofloxacin so that a single administration provides a full course of treatment. There are approximately one million TTP surgeries performed each year in the United States, and antibiotic ear drops are used in nearly all cases. Despite their routine use, no antibiotic ear drop has received FDA approval for this indication. Moreover, current ear drop products require multi-dose, multi-day regimens for efficacy. Full compliance with these regimens can be challenging, and missed antibiotic doses can compromise efficacy and increase the potential for bacterial resistance.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has assigned a PDUFA action date of December 25, 2015 for the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for OTIPRIO for the treatment of middle ear effusion in pediatric patients undergoing TTP surgery. If approved within the standard review period, Otonomy anticipates a commercial launch for OTIPRIO in the United States in the first quarter of 2016. OTIPRIO is also being evaluated for two potential label expansion indications: a Phase 2 feasibility trial has been completed in pediatric patients with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT), and a Phase 2 feasibility trial is ongoing for patients with otitis externa (swimmer's ear).

About Otonomy

Otonomy is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for diseases and disorders of the ear. Otonomy's proprietary technology provides sustained exposure of drugs to the ear following a single administration. Otonomy has three product candidates in development. OTIPRIO(TM) is an antibiotic that has completed Phase 3 clinical trials in pediatric patients with middle ear effusion at the time of tympanostomy tube placement surgery, and the FDA has assigned a PDUFA action date of December 25, 2015 for Otonomy's New Drug Application. OTO-104 is a steroid that has completed a Phase 2b clinical trial in 154 patients with Ménière's disease. Based on these results, Otonomy intends to initiate two parallel Phase 3 trials for OTO-104 in Ménière's disease patients with at least one trial initiated by the end of 2015. OTO-311 is an NMDA receptor antagonist in development as a treatment for tinnitus. A Phase 1 clinical safety trial for OTO-311 is expected to begin before the end of 2015.

About Recro Pharma, Inc.

Recro Pharma is a revenue generating specialty pharmaceutical company developing multiple non-opioid therapeutics for the treatment of pain. Recro Pharma is currently developing IV/IM meloxicam, a proprietary, long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor for treatment of acute post-operative pain, and Dex-IN, a proprietary intranasal formulation of dexmedetomidine, for the treatment of peri-procedural pain. Both compounds have successfully completed Phase II clinical trials. As Recro Pharma's product candidates are not in the opioid class of drugs, the Company believes its candidates would avoid many of the side effects associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, such as addiction, constipation and respiratory distress, while maintaining analgesic effect.

Recro Pharma also owns and operates an 87,000 square foot, DEA-licensed facility that manufactures five commercial products and receives royalties associated with the sales of these products.

Upon closing, Juno will receive an upfront payment of about $150 million, and in addition Celgene will purchase 9,137,672 shares of Juno's common stock at $93.00 per share. Celgene will receive the right to nominate a member to Juno's board of directors.

During the 10-year term of the collaboration, Celgene will have the right to purchase additional equity in Juno during specified windows and at specified market premiums subject to satisfaction of certain conditions by each party including Juno opting in on select Celgene programs, such that, at a maximum, Celgene could own up to 30% of Juno's common stock then outstanding.

Celgene has entered into a standstill agreement and agreed to certain lock-up provisions on its share ownership.

Celgene and Juno currently expect to complete the deal during the third quarter of 2015.

Merck's (MRK) approved cancer drug KEYTRUDA has shown superior overall survival compared to chemotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 in a pivotal phase 2/3 trial.

In the trial, dubbed KEYNOTE-010, two doses of KEYTRUDA - the FDA-approved 2mg/kg dose and a higher, investigational 10mg/kg dose, each given every 3 weeks - were compared to Docetaxel, a commonly used chemotherapy. A topline analysis revealed that treatment with both the doses of KEYTRUDA was associated with longer overall survival compared with Docetaxel treatment.

KEYTRUDA is approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response.

The label for KEYTRUDA currently says that an improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not yet been established, and the continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.

The Boxed Warning also states that Genvoya is not approved to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The most common side effect associated with Genvoya is nausea. Serious side effects include new or worsening kidney problems, decreased bone mineral density, fat redistribution and changes in the immune system (immune reconstitution syndrome). Health care providers are advised to monitor patients for kidney and bone side effects, the FDA said.

Genvoya should not be given with other antiretroviral products and may have drug interactions with a number of other commonly used medications.

STRIVE will study the safety of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, which uses a virus carrying a non-infectious Ebola virus gene on the volunteers to try to create an immune response from the patient to protect them against the disease, the Center for Disease Control explained.

Participants will receive the drug and will be closely monitored for six months by health experts to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness.

“A safe and effective vaccine would be a very important tool to stop Ebola in the future, and the frontline workers who are volunteering to participate are making a decision that could benefit health care professionals and communities wherever Ebola is a risk,” Center for Disease Control Director Tom Frieden said in the statement.

“We hope this vaccine will be proven effective, but in the meantime we must continue doing everything necessary to stop this epidemic - find every case, isolate and treat, safely and respectfully bury the dead, and find every single contact,” he added.

The vaccine trial comes after the recent 2014 outbreak of the Ebola virus epidemic, which began in southern Guinea and later spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal.

The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed at least 10,587 people since it started in 2014, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) estimates.

Participants will receive the drug and will be closely monitored for six months by health experts to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness.

“A safe and effective vaccine would be a very important tool to stop Ebola in the future, and the frontline workers who are volunteering to participate are making a decision that could benefit health care professionals and communities wherever Ebola is a risk,” Center for Disease Control Director Tom Frieden said in the statement.

“We hope this vaccine will be proven effective, but in the meantime we must continue doing everything necessary to stop this epidemic - find every case, isolate and treat, safely and respectfully bury the dead, and find every single contact,” he added.

The vaccine trial comes after the recent 2014 outbreak of the Ebola virus epidemic, which began in southern Guinea and later spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal.

The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed at least 10,587 people since it started in 2014, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) estimates.

Russia, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom are also working on developing a vaccine for the Ebola virus.",392.0

That label may resonate, especially this week, thanks to Turing Pharmaceuticals , which raised the price of a drug, Daraprim, that it had acquired from $13.50 a pill to $750. The  anger sparked by this move  forced the company to announce it would lower the price.

Under Clinton's plan, the federal government would cap out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs for patients with chronic and serious medical conditions at $250 a month. Americans could import drugs made in America from other countries where they are sold at cheaper prices. Medicare would be empowered to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.

Plus, she would end a tax credit that drug companies can take for consumer advertising. She would make a tax credit for research and development permanent, but drug companies that use it would have to meet unspecified targets for corporate investments in R&D. Clinton also would increase the Food and Drug Administration 's budget so it could speed approval of generic drugs.

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said Clinton's proposals to regulate drug prices would ""impose arbitrary spending caps"" on the industry.

""Secretary Clinton's proposal would turn back the clock on medical innovation and halt progress against the diseases that patients fear most,"" said John Castellani , president and CEO of PhRMA. ""These sweeping and far-reaching proposals would restrict patients' access to medicines, result in fewer new treatments for patients, cost countless jobs across the country and erode our nation's standing as the world leader in biomedical innovation.""

""Intrusive government regulation of a system that relies on entrepreneurial vision and private capital is a recipe for failure,"" said Jim Greenwood , president and CEO of the Biotechnology Industry Organization .

""We believe that fewer medicines would be produced and patient access to those medicines would be limited if the government set prices and became involved in private-sector research and development.""

Health insurance companies aren't wild about Clinton's proposal to cap out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs by consumers, because that could just leave insurers with a higher bill for medicines.

""We would just like some transparency for what goes into pricing the product,"" Marilyn Tavenner, who heads America's Health Insurance Plans ,  told the Wall Street Journal .

""We've obviously opposed the things that we don't like: capping the copays, that sort of thing, which we think just kind of pushes the problem in a different direction and doesn't really solve the problem,"" Tavenner said.

The Association of National Advertisers is upset that Clinton would treat consumer advertising for prescription drugs differently than other products for tax purposes.

""This approach raises very serious First Amendment issues and would be thrown out by the courts,"" ANA wrote in a blog post . ""The Supreme Court has been clear that manipulating the tax code to penalize disfavored speech runs afoul of the First Amendment.""

Treating drug advertising differently in the tax code would set a dangerous precedent, ANA contends.

""The tax code could become a vehicle for punishing any advertising which a shifting majority of lawmakers decides is not at that time 'politically correct,' "" it wrote.

Collegium's lead product candidate, Xtampza ER, is an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral formulation of oxycodone in development for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. The active ingredient in Xtampza is oxycodone, which is approved by the FDA and other regulators around the world in a number of both immediate-release and extended-release drug products. Collegium developed Xtampza using its proprietary DETERx® abuse-deterrent technology to address common methods of abuse, including chewing, crushing and/or dissolving, and then taking it orally or snorting or injecting.

About Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc.

Collegium is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing a portfolio of products that incorporate its patent-protected DETERx® technology platform for the treatment of chronic pain and other diseases. The DETERx oral drug delivery technology is designed to provide extended-release delivery, unique abuse-deterrent properties, and flexible dose administration options.

There is no cure for MS, though the disease typically subsides before inexplicably flaring up. But primary progressive MS, which affects about one in 10 MS patients, is different from relapsing MS because symptoms steadily worsen without the flareups.

Myelin is the protective sheath around nerve cells; axons are nerve fibers that transmit information between neurons.

""Currently, conventional needle-based therapeutic methods of acupuncture already exist, in which acupuncture needles are inserted into areas of or near meridians.

My best friend is allergic to gluten, my cousin is severely allergic to peanuts and my brother is allergic to dairy. At times, it seems like everyone I know has some sort of intolerance.

And as it turns out, I am not just being paranoid. According to a 2013 report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, food allergies have increased about 50 percent between 1997 and 2011. In fact, every three minutes an allergic reaction sends someone to the emergency room.

Though the number of people diagnosed with food allergies keeps increasing, there is no consensus on what process is responsible for the pattern. This is alarming because food allergies have no cure. Strict avoidance of potential allergens is recommended, but nothing can make allergies vanish.

Why has science failed us and why haven’t researchers developed a cure yet? One prevailing idea is the hygiene hypothesis.

Though we often think of ourselves as individuals, our body is actually an ecosystem for a vast number of microbes. We house over 10 trillion microbial cells (compared to our pitiful 1 trillion human cells) and these organisms coat our body surfaces to produce necessary vitamins, digest our food and help our immune system distinguish between friendly visitors and dangerous pathogens.

The hygiene hypothesis says that our complex body ecosystem has experienced a depletion in microbial diversity over the last century. Two contributing factors include increased consumption of processed items like sugar or pharmaceutical drugs and widespread usage of pesticides or harsh chemicals. However, the main reason why our delicate microflora balance seems to be under assault has to do with the physical environment.

Developed nations have become so clean that their surroundings do not contain the requisite germs needed to train our immune systems. As a result, our immune systems have not been educated to solely launch their defense systems against infectious agents. Since our naive immune systems do not receive the necessary input from their microbial neighbors, they tend to overreact when they come in contact with benign substances.

This environmental sanitation change has occurred within such a short evolutionary time span that humans have not had time to adapt without microbial guidance.

Examining the global incidences of food allergies shows that although most countries show increasing food allergy rates, this phenomenon is primarily a first world problem. How ironic that countries with the cleanliest environments suffer the most — who would have thought that the Western world’s quest for hygiene would be so problematic?

According to this hypothesis, we need to allow our microbiome to re-equilibrate. Perhaps stay away from antibacterial soaps, limit hand sanitizer use and eat more natural, organic foods.

Though these suggestions may help individuals temporarily cultivate a slightly richer microbiome, in the end these are very short-term fixes; the rise in food allergies seems more associated with specific lifestyles. It is literally the clean air we breathe and germ-free water we drink that is our downfall.

Scientists have not been able to develop a magical panacea for food allergies because this involves the enormous task of educating the immune system to stop misbehaving, and taking on the role of our microbiome. Who knows which specific organism allows our body to properly function? Each individual has a unique microbiome which continually changes throughout his life. It is the interaction of various organisms which allows our body to carry out specific tasks. Developing a cure-all is a monumental task. Though desensitization therapies exist — in which patients are gradually introduced to miniscule amounts of a food allergen until they can tolerate larger amounts without reacting to the substance — it cannot be tested on people with severe allergies.

As for now, all we can really do is find ways to change our lifestyle to incorporate more microbes into our body collections. Eventually if we wait long enough, evolution should do the trick and better equip our immune systems to deal with the clean environment. Regardless, we need to stop insulating ourselves from the world and its microorganism inhabitants! So — for the sake of your health — get up, get out, and don’t be afraid to get dirty.

Now is the perfect time to start to take measures to reduce and potentially eliminate additional airborne triggers, such as ragweed, which often worsen symptoms.

Instead of moving to a new climate to avoid allergies, take a few quick and easy steps to significantly reduce indoor air pollutants, which can heighten the effects of allergic reactions.

Manage your home’s cleanliness

Even though it’s hard to defend against the pollen and other allergy spikes that occur during the changing of seasons, there are many different steps you can take in your home to limit the impact of airborne pollutants.

1. Regulate dust. Control dust mites by using anti-dust mite covers and washing sheets in hot water about once a week.

2. Avoid smoke. Avoid non-ventilated and smoky rooms that could increase nose, throat and eye irritation.

3. Manage pet dander. If possible, keep pets off of furniture and out of the bedroom and bathroom to reduce the spread of their dander.

Improve the air inside your home

As the weather continues to get colder around the country, people will be spending more time indoors with the windows closed. Lack of ventilation can often cause buildup of particles in the air.

1. Filter first. Help reduce these irritants by installing an AccuClean Whole-Home Filtration Systemfrom American Standard Heating & Air Conditioning. The revolutionary system is 100 times more effective than a standard 1-inch throwaway filter, removing up to 99.98 percent of allergens from the air.

2. Control moisture. Keeping your home’s humidity between 30-60 percent will help prevent the gathering of dust mites. Simple actions like turning on a fan when bathing or cooking, using a dehumidifier, and not overwatering plants are all quick ways to keep the humidity levels down.

Avoid pollutants during home renovation projects

Being cooped up during colder weather is often a time to work on the home renovation projects that have been put off while you were enjoying the warm summer sun. Before these projects kick off, keep a few things in mind to help reduce in-home air pollutants.

1. Cover up. When tearing down or putting up drywall, ensure the room is sealed off from the rest of house by putting up plastic sheets over doors and closing vents. Sealing the room will minimize the spread of dust and other particles from entering the rest of the home.

2. Paint responsibly. If you’re adding a splash of color to a room or simply restoring an old piece of future with a new paint job, select a low VOC paint. Breathing in high levels of VOCs can lead to worsened asthma symptoms, headaches, throat irritation and more, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Parkinson's is a neurological disorder that afflicts about one million Americans. An estimated 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson's each year, according to the National Institutes of Health.

There are no cures for Parkinson's or essential tremor, a condition previously called benign essential tremor characterized by uncontrolled muscle movement.

Parkinson's is typically diagnosed in people over 60 years old, while essential tremor usually occurs in those over 40.

The implant includes a battery-powered, rechargeable electrical pulse generator that is implanted under the skin of the upper chest and wire leads that are attached to electrodes placed within the brain, the FDA said. Serious adverse events include intracranial bleeding, which can lead to stroke, paralysis or death, the agency warned. Other adverse events included infection and dislocation of the device lead under the skin.

It was unclear Friday whether Shkreli would also resign from KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, a separate firm where he was named CEO in November.

Federal prosecutors accused Shkreli, 32, of perpetuating a Ponzi-like scheme on investors in former hedge funds he led, as well as at Retrophin, a pharmaceutical company he founded and previously headed. Authorities said Shkreli misappropriated funds, lied about investment returns and conspired to defraud Retrophin by secretly issuing company stock to settle disputes with burned investors.

The criminal indictment handed up in Brooklyn, New York, accused Evan Greebel, 42, a New York lawyer who served as Retrophin's outside counsel, of aiding the alleged scheme.

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday filed civil charges against Shkreli.

After pleading not guilty at a Thursday arraignment, Shkreli denied all of the allegations and issued a statement saying he expects to be vindicated.

""It is no coincidence that these charges, the result of investigations which have been languishing for considerable time, have been filed at the same time of Shkreli's high-profile, controversial and yet unrelated activities,"" Shkreli spokesman Craig Stevens said in the statement.

The statement referred to the public furor that erupted this year after Shkreli raised the price of a Turing medication called Daraprim by more than 5,000% — from $13.50 a pill to $750. The therapy treats toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease that afflicts people with weakened immune systems, such as AIDS patients and pregnant women.

From the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: ""In certain circumstances, it is desirable to inject medication directly into human tissue. Typically, syringes or pen injection devices are used to inject medicaments into tissue areas, such as the intramuscular tissue layer, the subcutaneous tissue layer, and the intradermal tissue layer.

""The assembly and operation of a typical pen injection device, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0229562, published on Oct. 12, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

""Pen injection devices, such as the exemplary pen injector 100, as shown in FIG. 1, typically comprise a dose knob/button 24, an outer sleeve 13, and a cap 21. The dose knob/button 24 allows a user to set the dosage of medication to be injected. The outer sleeve 13 is gripped by the user when injecting medication. The cap 21 is used by the user to securely hold the pen injector device 100 in a shirt pocket, purse or other suitable location.

""FIG. 2 is an exploded view of an exemplary drug delivery pen shown in FIG. 1. The dose knob/button 24 has a dual purpose and is used to both set the dosage of the medication to be injected and to inject the dosed medicament via the lead screw 7 and stopper 15 through the medicament cartridge 12, which is attached to the drug delivery pen through a lower housing 17. In standard drug delivery pens, the dosing and delivery mechanisms are all found within the outer sleeve 13 and are not described in greater detail here as they are understood by those knowledgeable of the prior art. The distal movement of the plunger or stopper 15 within the medicament cartridge 12 causes medication to be forced into the needle 11 of the hub 20. The medicament cartridge 12 is sealed by septum 16, which is punctured by a septum penetrating needle cannula 18 located within the hub 20. The hub 20 is preferably screwed onto the lower housing 17, although other attachment means can be used such as attaching to the cartridge. To protect a user, or anyone who handles the pen injection device 100, an outer shield 69, which attaches to the hub 20, covers the hub. An inner shield 59 covers the patient needle 11 within the outer shield 69. The inner shield 59 can be secured to the hub 20 to cover the patient needle 11 by any suitable means, such as an interference fit or a snap fit. The outer shield 69 and inner shield 59 are removed prior to use. The cap 21 fits snugly against outer sleeve 13 to allow a user to securely carry the drug delivery pen 100.

""The medicament cartridge 12 is typically a glass tube sealed at one end with the septum 16 and sealed at the other end with the stopper 15. The septum 16 is pierceable by a septum penetrating cannula 18 in the hub 20, but does not move with respect to the medicament cartridge 12. The stopper 15 is axially displaceable within the medicament cartridge 12 while maintaining a fluid tight seal.

""Following an injection, the used needle 11 and hub assembly 20, or 'sharps', is removed and must be properly disposed of. Used sharps may become contaminated by body fluids and the like creating a hazard for anyone that may handle them following their use. Sharps disposal containers store the disposed sharps and prevent unintentional contact with any object disposed therein.

""One problem associated with shipping new product and a sharps disposal container is that the new product and the sharps disposal container are each contained in separate rigid containers, such that the overall size of the shipping container is the size of both containers combined. Accordingly, a need exists for a shipping container that integrates a sharps disposal container with a new product storage container such that the size of the shipping container is substantially the same size as the larger of the storage container or the sharps disposal container.""

Supplementing the background information on this patent, VerticalNews reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the shipping container integrates a sharps disposal container with a storage container containing new product such that one container is disposed inside the other for shipping.

""In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a storage container containing new product is disposed within a sharps disposal container for shipping, thereby reducing the size of the shipping container.

""In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a sharps disposal container having a movable partition is disposed within a storage container for shipping, thereby reducing the size of the shipping container.

""The shipping container of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention integrates a disposal container with a new product storage container for shipping. The storage container stores new product. A disposal container receives used product, such as used sharps. One of the storage container and the disposal container is nested within the other of the storage container and the disposal container for shipping. A lid is adapted to be connected to the outermost one of the disposal container and the storage container for shipping and to a top of the disposal container for receiving the used product. Accordingly, a shipping container is provided that is not significantly larger than required to store the new product.

""Objects, advantages, and salient features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses exemplary embodiments of the invention.""

Accordingly, a need exists for a shipping container that integrates a sharps disposal container with a new product storage container such that the size of the shipping container is substantially the same size as the larger of the storage container or the sharps disposal container.""

Supplementing the background information on this patent, VerticalNews reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the shipping container integrates a sharps disposal container with a storage container containing new product such that one container is disposed inside the other for shipping.

""In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a storage container containing new product is disposed within a sharps disposal container for shipping, thereby reducing the size of the shipping container.

""In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a sharps disposal container having a movable partition is disposed within a storage container for shipping, thereby reducing the size of the shipping container.

""The shipping container of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention integrates a disposal container with a new product storage container for shipping. The storage container stores new product. A disposal container receives used product, such as used sharps. One of the storage container and the disposal container is nested within the other of the storage container and the disposal container for shipping. A lid is adapted to be connected to the outermost one of the disposal container and the storage container for shipping and to a top of the disposal container for receiving the used product. Accordingly, a shipping container is provided that is not significantly larger than required to store the new product.

""Objects, advantages, and salient features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses exemplary embodiments of the invention.""

* Pancreatectomy predicted survival rates ranged from 81% to 100%, with a quality benchmark of 91.3%;

* Esophagectomy predicted survival rates ranged from 88% to 98%, with a quality benchmark of 91.7%;

* Aortic valve replacement predicted survival rates ranged from 92% to 97%, with a quality benchmark of 95.6%; and

* Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair predicted survival rates ranged from 86% to 99%, with a quality benchmark of 97.3%.

Harvard School of Public Health Professor Ashish Jha said, ""When it comes to major surgery, it's hard to think of an outcome more important than whether you live or die,"" adding, ""It's amazing there is such variability in mortality from these common surgeries, and patients should know that.""

Classic CAH is a genetic disorder that results in an enzyme deficiency altering the production of adrenal steroids. Because of this deficiency, the adrenal glands have little to no cortisol biosynthesis resulting in a potentially life-threatening condition. If left untreated, classic CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration and eventually death. Even with cortisol replacement, persistent elevation of ACTH from the pituitary gland results in excessive androgen levels leading to virilization of females including precocious puberty, menstrual irregularity, short stature, hirsutism, acne and fertility problems.

Corticosteroids are the current standard of care for classic CAH which are used to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency and reduce the excessive ACTH levels and androgen excess. However, the dose and duration of steroid use required to suppress ACTH is well above the normal physiological level of cortisol resulting in metabolic syndrome, bone loss, growth impairment, and Cushing's syndrome as common and serious side effects.

NBI-77860 is a potent, selective non-peptide CRF receptor antagonist as demonstrated in a range of in vitro/in vivo assays and human clinical studies. Blockade of CRF receptors at the pituitary has been shown to decrease the release of ACTH, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal steroids including androgens, and potentially the symptoms associated with classic CAH. Lower ACTH levels would also reduce the amount of exogenous corticosteroid necessary for classic CAH patients to thrive avoiding the side-effects currently associated with excessive steroid therapy.

The 1401 study is a phase I/II open-label, sequential cohort, single ascending dose pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study assessing three doses of NBI-77860. The fifteen adolescent females with classic CAH will be split into three cohorts and each will receive one dose of NBI-77860 at bedtime.

""What people don't realize is that peripheral artery disease is a very common and potentially serious condition,"" said Dr. Stinis, who is director of peripheral interventions in the Division of Cardiology at Scripps Clinic. ""Importantly, most people who have the disease are entirely asymptomatic and don't even know they have it.

""Those who do suffer from exercise-related symptoms typically develop a progressive decline in their ability to remain active, yet they often chalk up their symptoms to just getting older,"" he said. ""This procedure is the latest example of how Scripps Health is making the best cardiovascular program in the region even better.""

Vascular patient benefits from new balloon

The drug-coated balloon angioplasty was a much-needed option for Ralla Rubin, 82, of San Diego, who was the first Scripps patient to receive the treatment from Dr. Stinis after FDA approval. Since the onset of burning pain in her lower leg about two years ago, Ralla has been unable to attend exercise class or walk to the grocery store from her Clairemont neighborhood home. She previously underwent two interventional procedures - a traditional balloon angioplasty and a stent implant - but the blockage returned.

After each procedure, Ralla's arteries developed excessive scar tissue, which created new blockage, Dr. Stinis said.

""I just want to be able to walk again,"" Ralla said prior to the procedure with the drug-coated balloon. ""I'm hopeful and thankful that Scripps offered me the option to try this new treatment.""

Affecting an estimated 8 million to 12 million people in the United States, peripheral artery disease is a debilitating condition that occurs when arteries become narrowed or blocked by plaque build-up, restricting blood flow. The condition commonly affects arteries in the upper legs and can cause recurrent and painful muscle cramping in the thigh and/or upper calf during exercise. The discomfort can impair a patient's ability to adequately exercise, and consequently interferes with a patient's ability to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle.

In its more advanced form, peripheral artery disease can lead to a critical restriction in blood flow to the legs and feet, which is often associated with continuous pain, non-healing wounds or gangrene. If not properly treated, the condition can lead to life-threatening complications, and is associated with a four to five time higher risk for heart attack or stroke, according to research published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2010.

Once peripheral artery disease is diagnosed, patients can benefit from aggressive lifestyle modification, such as smoking cessation, dietary changes and cholesterol medication.

""When conservative measures fail, we typically recommend intervention to mechanically improve blood flow,"" Dr. Stinis said. ""In these cases, the drug-coated balloon gives us a new and important minimally invasive treatment option.""

Drug-coated balloons are designed to help restore blood flow by reopening blocked arteries while simultaneously delivering a medication to the artery wall. During the new procedure, an inflated balloon pushes the plaque away to create a channel for blood flow, and the medication on the balloon surface is deposited into the artery wall. The balloon is then removed with only the medication left behind.

Scripps part of clinical trial

Clinical studies, including work done at Scripps, have shown that delivering the medication via the balloon helps keep arteries open longer than standard procedures, including a traditional balloon angioplasty, Dr. Stinis said.

In particular, research has shown treatment with the Medtronic device reduced the need to have a similar repeat procedure within the next year, which is more common with other types of interventional procedures for the treatment of the condition.

Innovative technology such as the IN.PACT Admiral device demonstrates the leadership of Scripps in heart care and research. The $456 million Prebys Cardiovascular Institute, which is scheduled to open in March, will be a center for innovation that brings together top researchers, physicians and staff. The institute will incorporate leading-edge wireless technologies and individualized medicine for the best in patient care.

Each year more than 76,000 patients receive their cardiovascular care from Scripps, making it San Diego County's largest heart care provider and the only one in the region consistently recognized by U.S. News & World Report as one of the best in the country.

Patients were dosed with each drug for seven days and blood samples were obtained over 24 hours to obtain pharmacokinetic data.

This study confirmed previously published data for Envarsus and showed greater bioavailability (p<0.0001) and a flatter PK profile characterized by lower peak-to-trough fluctuation (p<0.001) and delayed time to peak concentrations of 6 hrs (p=<0.001) compared to both Prograf and Astagraf. At equivalent exposure, Envarsus achieves at least a 30% dose reduction requirement and a substantively lower peak blood concentration (p=<0.005) compared to the two comparator products.

""This novel scientifically rigorous study design implemented by Dr. Simon Tremblay and our team demonstrates that there are potentially clinically meaningful differences between tacrolimus formulations and provides results to transplant clinicians that can be directly applied to patient management."" said Rita Alloway, PharmD, Research Professor of Medicine, University of Cincinnati Medical Center.

""The results from ASTCOFF provide additional evidence of the differentiated PK profile of Envarsus XR and will provide further guidance on how best patients can be switched to Envarsus,"" said William Polvino, M.D., chief executive officer of Veloxis. ""We look forward to providing Envarsus XR as an option to transplant patients in the near future.""

Two out of every one million people in Europe and North America are diagnosed with aplastic anemia per year, a portion of which are severe cases4,5. The exact cause of the disease is still unknown, but most cases of SAA are believed to be triggered by an autoimmune reaction where the body attacks blood-forming stem cells located in the bone marrow3,6. As a result, patients with SAA are at risk for life-threatening infections or bleeding6.

Treatment of SAA is focused on increasing a patient's blood cell count. The current standard of care includes IST or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation6. Of patients treated with IST, one-quarter to one-third will not respond and 30-40% of responders will relapse, causing symptoms to return6. Approximately 40% of SAA patients who don't respond to initial IST die from infection or bleeding within five years of their diagnosis1.

The CHMP positive opinion is based on the results of a pivotal open-label Phase 2 study (ELT112523) and two supporting Phase 2 studies (ELT116826 and ELT116643) conducted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The pivotal study demonstrated a hematologic response (40%) in SAA patients treated with Revolade who had an insufficient response to IST. The most common adverse reactions (20%) in the pivotal single-arm study of 43 patients were nausea (33%), fatigue (28%), cough (23%), diarrhea (21%), and headache (21%)7.

The European Commission will review the CHMP recommendation and is expected to deliver its final decision within three months. The decision will be applicable to all 28 EU member states plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. In August of 2014, eltrombopag (marketed as Promacta in the USA), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for once-daily use in patients with SAA who have had an insufficient response to IST.

Opdivo is associated with immune-mediated: pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, rash, encephalitis, other adverse reactions; infusion reactions; and embryofetal toxicity. Please see additional Important Safety Information section below.

""Advanced melanoma continues to be one of the deadliest and most challenging cancers to treat, and ongoing research in Immuno-Oncology from clinical trials like CheckMate -066 shows the potential to provide improved overall survival for newly diagnosed patients with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma,"" said Jeffrey S. Weber, M.D., PhD, deputy director of the Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center at the NYU Langone Medical Center. ""This important news means that we now have another new option to offer patients with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma.""

A supplemental Biologics License Application for Opdivo in BRAF V600 mutation positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, which was filed subsequent to data from CheckMate -066, is still under review with the FDA.

Opdivo Demonstrated Efficacy in Newly Diagnosed BRAF Wild-Type Advanced Melanoma

CheckMate -066 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of treatment-naive patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF WT melanoma. Patients were randomized to receive Opdivo (intravenously 3 mg/kg q2w; n=210) or dacarbazine (intravenously 1000 mg/m2 q3w; n=208). The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR).

In the trial, Opdivo demonstrated superior OS versus chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Results were based on the interim analysis conducted on 47% of the total planned events for OS (50 for the Opdivo arm; 96 for the dacarbazine arm). The median OS was not reached for Opdivo and was 10.8 months (95% CI: 9.3-12.1) in the dacarbazine arm (HR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.30-0.60; p<0.0001). Median PFS more than doubled with Opdivo (5.1 months [95% CI: 3.5-10.8] vs. 2.2 months [95% CI: 2.1-2.4] for patients treated with dacarbazine [HR=0.43; 95% CI: 0.34-0.56; p<0.0001]). ORR with Opdivo was 34% (4% complete response rate, 30% partial response rate [95% CI: 28-41]) compared to 9% with dacarbazine (1% complete response rate, 8% partial response rate [95% CI: 5-13]). At the time of analysis, 88% (63/72) of Opdivo-treated patients had ongoing responses, which included 43 patients with ongoing responses of six months or longer.

Last year, the CheckMate -066 trial was stopped early following a recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring Committee based on their analysis which showed evidence of superior OS in patients receiving Opdivo compared to the control arm. As a result, patients in the trial were unblinded and patients who had received dacarbazine were allowed to receive Opdivo. Dacarbazine was selected as the comparator in this study because, at the time the study protocol was designed, it represented the standard of care in many regions outside of the U.S. where Yervoy had not yet been approved for first-line use.

In the trial, serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving Opdivo. Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving Opdivo. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients receiving Opdivo were gamma-glutamyltransferase increase (3.9%) and diarrhea (3.4%). Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of Opdivo in 7% of patients and dose interruption in 26% of patients. The most common adverse reactions in CheckMate -066 (>20%) reported with Opdivo versus dacarbazine were fatigue (49% vs. 39%), musculoskeletal pain (32% vs. 25%), rash (28% vs. 12%), and pruritus (23% vs. 12%).

""Advanced melanoma continues to be one of the deadliest and most challenging cancers to treat, and ongoing research in Immuno-Oncology from clinical trials like CheckMate -066 shows the potential to provide improved overall survival for newly diagnosed patients with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma,"" said Jeffrey S. Weber, M.D., PhD, deputy director of the Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center at the NYU Langone Medical Center. ""This important news means that we now have another new option to offer patients with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma.""

A supplemental Biologics License Application for Opdivo in BRAF V600 mutation positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, which was filed subsequent to data from CheckMate -066, is still under review with the FDA.

Opdivo Demonstrated Efficacy in Newly Diagnosed BRAF Wild-Type Advanced Melanoma

CheckMate -066 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of treatment-naive patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF WT melanoma. Patients were randomized to receive Opdivo (intravenously 3 mg/kg q2w; n=210) or dacarbazine (intravenously 1000 mg/m2 q3w; n=208). The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR).

In the trial, Opdivo demonstrated superior OS versus chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Results were based on the interim analysis conducted on 47% of the total planned events for OS (50 for the Opdivo arm; 96 for the dacarbazine arm). The median OS was not reached for Opdivo and was 10.8 months (95% CI: 9.3-12.1) in the dacarbazine arm (HR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.30-0.60; p<0.0001). Median PFS more than doubled with Opdivo (5.1 months [95% CI: 3.5-10.8] vs. 2.2 months [95% CI: 2.1-2.4] for patients treated with dacarbazine [HR=0.43; 95% CI: 0.34-0.56; p<0.0001]). ORR with Opdivo was 34% (4% complete response rate, 30% partial response rate [95% CI: 28-41]) compared to 9% with dacarbazine (1% complete response rate, 8% partial response rate [95% CI: 5-13]). At the time of analysis, 88% (63/72) of Opdivo-treated patients had ongoing responses, which included 43 patients with ongoing responses of six months or longer.

Last year, the CheckMate -066 trial was stopped early following a recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring Committee based on their analysis which showed evidence of superior OS in patients receiving Opdivo compared to the control arm. As a result, patients in the trial were unblinded and patients who had received dacarbazine were allowed to receive Opdivo. Dacarbazine was selected as the comparator in this study because, at the time the study protocol was designed, it represented the standard of care in many regions outside of the U.S. where Yervoy had not yet been approved for first-line use.

In the trial, serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving Opdivo. Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving Opdivo. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients receiving Opdivo were gamma-glutamyltransferase increase (3.9%) and diarrhea (3.4%). Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of Opdivo in 7% of patients and dose interruption in 26% of patients. The most common adverse reactions in CheckMate -066 (>20%) reported with Opdivo versus dacarbazine were fatigue (49% vs. 39%), musculoskeletal pain (32% vs. 25%), rash (28% vs. 12%), and pruritus (23% vs. 12%).

From the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: ""In recent years, drug-eluting implantable medical devices, such as, for example, stents, stent grafts, anastomosis devices, vascular grafts, vascular patches, AV shunts, catheters, guide wires, balloons, and filters, which contain one or more therapeutic drugs for local administration and controlled release of such therapeutic drugs, have gained more and more acceptance in the medical device industry. These implantable medical devices (or at least portions thereof) are typically formed of or coated by a biocompatible polymer that encapsulates or otherwise contains the therapeutic drug(s), which can be released into the surrounding environment from the implantable medical devices in a controlled and sustained manner.

""The biocompatible polymer as described hereinabove can be made from a polymeric solution via various different processes, including, but not limited to: spray drying (for preparation of coatings), solvent casting or spin coating (for preparation of thin films or membranes), and spinning (for preparation of fibers). The polymeric solution typically contains one or more biocompatible homopolymers or copolymers (either biostable or biodegradable) and one or more therapeutic drugs dissolved in one or more solvents.

""However, the solvent(s) used in the polymeric solution may have deleterious impact on living tissues. It is therefore important to remove the solvent(s) as completely as possible from the final polymeric composition, or at least reduce the solvent content in the final polymeric composition to a safe level defined by applicable government guidelines, while without reducing the amount of therapeutic drug(s) contained therein.

""For example, the polymeric solution can be coated onto or cast into at least a portion of an implantable medical device to form a drug-containing thin polymeric film (e.g., about 3 to 6 mils), and the solvent(s) contained in the polymeric film can be gradually removed by evaporation under ambient conditions (i.e., room temperature and atmospheric pressure). The final solvent content in the polymeric film typically ranges from about 5 wt % to about 10 wt %, by total weight of the film. This solvent removal method under ambient conditions results in little or no reduction of the drug content in the polymeric film.

""Alternatively, the solvent(s) contained in the polymeric film can be removed by low temperature drying, which is typically carried out at temperatures ranging from about 45.degree. C. to about 60.degree. C. under vacuum. The low temperature drying method can remove the solvent(s) with significant efficiency, resulting in a reduced final solvent content of from about 2 wt % to about 5 wt %, with little or not reduction of the drug content in the polymeric film.

""Further, the solvent(s) can be removed by high temperature drying, which is typically carried out at temperatures ranging from about 60.degree. C. to about 110.degree. C. The high temperature drying method can further reduce of the final solvent content in the polymeric film. However, because the therapeutic drug(s) contained in the polymeric film is typically in an amorphous state and is therefore thermally unstable, the high temperature drying method may cause degradation of the therapeutic drug(s) and lead to significant reduction of the drug content in the polymeric film.

""There is therefore a continuing need for improved methods for effectively removing solvent(s) from a drug-containing polymeric composition, without removing or degrading the therapeutic drug(s) contained therein.""

Supplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""The present invention in one aspect relates to a method comprising: forming a drug-containing polymeric composition comprising a biocompatible polymeric matrix with one or more therapeutic agents encapsulated therein, wherein the polymeric matrix further comprises one or more organic or aqueous solvents in an amount ranging from about 0.5 wt % to about 10 wt % of the total weight of the polymeric matrix; and treating the drug-containing polymeric composition using a low-temperature drying process at a processing temperature of less than 60.degree. C., so as to reduce solvent content in said composition to from about 1 ppm to about 10,000 ppm.

""The term 'polymer' or 'polymeric' as used herein refers to any material, composition, structure, or article that comprises one or more polymers, which can be homopolymers, copolymers, or polymer blends.

""The term 'biocompatible' as used herein refers to any material, composition, structure, or article that have essentially no toxic or injurious impact on the living tissues or living systems which the material, composition, structure, or article is in contact with and produce essentially no immunological response in such living tissues or living systems. More particularly, the material, composition, structure, or article has essentially no adverse impact on the growth and any other desired characteristics of the cells of the living tissues or living systems that are in contact with the material, composition, structure, or article. Generally, the methods for testing the biocompatibility of a material, composition, structure, or article is well known in the art.

""In another aspect, the present invention relates to a drug-containing polymeric composition comprising a biocompatible polymeric matrix with one or more therapeutic agents encapsulated therein, wherein the polymeric matrix further comprises one or more organic or aqueous solvents in an amount from about 1 ppm (parts per million) to about 10,000 ppm.

""The drug-containing polymeric compositions of the present invention preferably are first formed by one or more conventional processing steps to achieve a relatively low initial solvent content from about from about 0.5 wt % to about 10 wt % of the total weight of the polymeric matrix, followed by one or more low temperature processing steps to further reduce the solvent content to a range from about 1 ppm to about 10,000 ppm. By first reducing the solvent content using conventional processing steps, porosity in the final composition resulting from the low temperature drying step can be significantly reduced, while the solvent content in the final composition can be reduced to a desired level (e.g., less than 10,000 ppm), without removing the active therapeutic agents from the composition.

""Conventional processing steps that can be used for forming the initial drug-containing polymeric compositions of relatively low initial solvent contents include, but are not limited to: solution processing and extrusion, melt processing using solvents and plasticizers, processing from gels and viscous solutions, solvent extraction, coating, co-extrusion, wire-coating, spinning disk, wet and dry fiber spinning, electrostatic fiber spinning, injection molding, and compression molding.

""Low temperature processing steps that can be used for further reducing the solvent content in the drug-containing polymeric compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to: lyophilization (also referred to as freeze drying), super-critical fluid extraction, and azeotropic extraction. The low temperature processes of the present invention function to increase the loading dose or concentration of drugs or other active agents in the drug-containing polymeric composition.

""The drug-containing compositions of the present invention preferably comprise one or more bioabsorbable polymers and can be formed into various structures, including, but not limited to: films, fibers and tubes. The drug-containing compositions of the present invention can be readily incorporated into drug delivery devices, either as polymeric coatings or as integrated parts of the devices, for sustained and controlled local delivery of therapeutic drugs. Different geometries and performance characteristics of the drug delivery devices can be achieved, by adjusting the drug-containing polymeric compositions and/or the processing conditions used for fabricating the devices.

""In a preferred but not necessary embodiment of the present invention, the drug delivery device is a stent comprised of bioabsorbable polymers with drugs or other pharmaceutically active agents incorporated therein. The drugs or other pharmaceutically active agents are incorporated into, or coated onto, the stent in significantly greater amounts than in prior art stents. Likewise, radiopaque markers may also be incorporated into or coated onto the stent, to enable visualization of the stent and thereby more precise placement of the stent in a patient's body. The delivery of greater amounts of drugs and/or other pharmaceutically active agents by the device of the present invention, in combination with the radiopaque markers, tends to improve the efficacy in treating a targeted site, disease or condition.

The delivery of greater amounts of drugs and/or other pharmaceutically active agents by the device of the present invention, in combination with the radiopaque markers, tends to improve the efficacy in treating a targeted site, disease or condition.

""Other aspects, features and advantages of the invention will be more fully apparent from the ensuing disclosure and appended claims.""

Hedrick, M.D. President and CEO of Cytori Therapeutics. ""The pilot trial data showed evidence that our lead therapeutic could substantially improve hand function and overall quality of life in this group of patients that today have limited effective therapeutic options.""

The STAR trial will begin enrolling in 2015 and will include 80 patients, in up to 12 centers in the United States. The trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of a single administration of Cytori's lead cellular therapeutic, ECCS-50, in scleroderma patients with hand dysfunction. The impairment in hand function is typically progressive and can result in chronic pain, blood flow changes and often profound disability. The available treatments often have minimal impact and those for advanced disease are often accompanied by significant adverse effects.

""We are extremely excited about the approval of the STAR trial. Dr. Dinesh Khanna, one of the principal investigators, is a widely respected international scleroderma expert, and his participation is a strong endorsement of this trial. The International Scleroderma Network welcomes this novel therapeutic approach, which aims to improve scleroderma hand function. If this advanced cell therapy by Cytori Therapeutics proves effective, this will represent a unique and deeply needed option for patients,"" said Shelley Ensz, Founder and President, International Scleroderma Network.

Dr. Hedrick will provide an update on current corporate activities and developments, including this recently announced STAR trial, at Biotech Showcase on Monday, January 12 at 3:30 PM Pacific Time, in room C-Mission 11 at the Parc 55 Wyndham Hotel, San Francisco.

A live audio webcast of the presentation will be available under the investor relations section of Cytori's website at www.cytori.com. A replay of the presentation will be available for 90 days following the event. Please connect to Cytori's website several minutes prior to the start of the webcast to ensure adequate time for any software download that may be necessary.

Additionally, Cytori will be hosting an information session dedicated to its planned STAR trial and scleroderma and featuring Dr. Khanna. The session will be held on Wednesday, January 14, 2015 from 1:30 PM to 4:30 PM, at the Prescott Hotel, 545 Post Street, San Francisco. Please contact Shawn Richardson at ir@Cytori.com for more information.

A live audio webcast of Dr. Khanna's scleroderma and STAR trial related remarks will also be available under the investor relations section of Cytori's website at www.cytori.com. A replay of the presentation will be available for 90 days following the event.

Cytori Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CYTX) announced today that the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), a division of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has given final approval to its application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to begin a pivotal trial (the ""STAR trial"") to evaluate Cytori Cell Therapy(TM) as a potential treatment for impaired hand function in scleroderma.",BWR,Business Wire,True,"['cappro', 'ctrial', 'c23', 'npress', 'c13', 'c22', 'ccat', 'ncat', 'nfact', 'nfcpin']",FDA Approves Cytori U.S. Pivotal Scleroderma Trial,"FDA Approves Cytori U.S. Pivotal Scleroderma Trial""We are pleased to be one step closer to bringing cell therapy into the mainstream of medicine,"" said Marc H. Hedrick, M.D. President and CEO of Cytori Therapeutics. ""The pilot trial data showed evidence that our lead therapeutic could substantially improve hand function and overall quality of life in this group of patients that today have limited effective therapeutic options.""

The STAR trial will begin enrolling in 2015 and will include 80 patients, in up to 12 centers in the United States. The trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of a single administration of Cytori's lead cellular therapeutic, ECCS-50, in scleroderma patients with hand dysfunction. The impairment in hand function is typically progressive and can result in chronic pain, blood flow changes and often profound disability. The available treatments often have minimal impact and those for advanced disease are often accompanied by significant adverse effects.

""We are extremely excited about the approval of the STAR trial. Dr. Dinesh Khanna, one of the principal investigators, is a widely respected international scleroderma expert, and his participation is a strong endorsement of this trial. The International Scleroderma Network welcomes this novel therapeutic approach, which aims to improve scleroderma hand function. If this advanced cell therapy by Cytori Therapeutics proves effective, this will represent a unique and deeply needed option for patients,"" said Shelley Ensz, Founder and President, International Scleroderma Network.

Dr. Hedrick will provide an update on current corporate activities and developments, including this recently announced STAR trial, at Biotech Showcase on Monday, January 12 at 3:30 PM Pacific Time, in room C-Mission 11 at the Parc 55 Wyndham Hotel, San Francisco.

But the biggest change for Walgreens' clinics occurred in April 2013, when the company announced that its clinics would go beyond treating common acute ailments to offer monitoring and management of several chronic health conditions, ranging from asthma and emphysema to diabetes, high blood pressure and thyroid disorders. The move is a controversial one because it is stoutly opposed by a number of medical organizations, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, which contends that reliance on retail clinics can result in fragmentation of a patient's health care unless it is coordinated with a patient's primary care physician.

Some physicians who acknowledge that the retail clinic can play a viable role in treating common acute illnesses express reservations about their involvement in chronic care, arguing that chronic care management should be customized to the individual patient and that it requires involvement by a primary care doctor or specialist who knows the patient.

""Furthermore, there has been desired a highly safe antimicrobial agent that show no adverse reactions even if it is ingested on a daily basis.

""Means for Solving the Problem

""The inventors of the present invention paid attention to the fact that a protein fraction in the middle of purification obtainable in the production process of lactoferrin markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of lactoferrins, and conducted various researches on protein components of the fraction.

""Then, they confirmed that, among the aforementioned components, ribonuclease-4 which is a milk protein not having antimicrobial activity by itself, markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of lactoferrin or lactoferrin hydrolysate, and accomplished the present invention.

""Antimicrobial Activity Enhancing Agent"" in Patent Application Approval Process (USPTO 20150250184)The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding protein contained in tear, saliva, peripheral blood, milk and so forth in the living body, and it is known to show an antimicrobial activity against harmful microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Candida yeasts and Clostridium bacteria (Non-patent document 1). Further, it is also known to show an antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus and Enterococcus bacteria at a concentration of 0.5 to 30 mg/ml (Non-patent document 2).

""Further, it is also known a composition containing a lactoferrin hydrolysate for inhibiting adhesion of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli to alimentary canal epithelial cells (Patent document 1).

""In addition to the above, it is known that Lactoferricin (registered trademark), which is a lactoferrin-derived peptide obtainable from a pepsin digestion product of lactoferrin, has an antimicrobial activity (Non-patent documents 3 and 4).

""Furthermore, it is investigated a method for enhancing antimicrobial activity of lactoferrin or lactoferrin hydrolysate mentioned above by combining an ingredient other than such lactoferrins.

""For example, it is known an antimicrobial agent containing a compound selected from the group consisting of decomposition products of lactoferrins, lactoferrin-related antimicrobial peptides, and arbitrary mixtures of these, and a casein decomposition product as active ingredients (Patent document 2).

""Further, it is also known an antimicrobial agent containing a compound selected from the group consisting of decomposition products of lactoferrins, lactoferrin-related antimicrobial peptides, and arbitrary mixtures of these, and a metal-binding protein as active ingredients (Patent document 3). As the metal-binding protein, lactoferrins, transferrin, conalbumin and casein phosphopeptides are mentioned.

""Further, it is disclosed an antimicrobial agent containing a decomposition product of lactoferrins and/or an antimicrobial peptide derived from the decomposition product, and lysozyme as active ingredients (Patent document 4).

""Further, it is known a composition consisting of an emulsion of an enzymatic decomposition product of lactoferrins, an antimicrobial peptide obtainable from an enzymatic decomposition product of lactoferrins or a chemically synthesized peptide containing a part of amino acid sequence of lactoferrins, and an aliphatic acid (Patent document 5).

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent application, VerticalNews journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent application: ""Problems to be Solved by the Invention

""Lactoferrin and lactoferrin hydrolysate (henceforth also collectively referred to as 'lactoferrins') are known from the past to have an antimicrobial activity. And in order to further improve the antimicrobial activity of lactoferrins, methods of combining lactoferrins and various compounds have been investigated.

""However, combinations that markedly enhance the antimicrobial effect of lactoferrins are scarcely known.

""In particular, there has been desired a method that can enhance the antimicrobial activity of lactoferrins even with an extremely small amount of a substance to be added to lactoferrins.

""Furthermore, there has been desired a highly safe antimicrobial agent that show no adverse reactions even if it is ingested on a daily basis.

""Means for Solving the Problem

""The inventors of the present invention paid attention to the fact that a protein fraction in the middle of purification obtainable in the production process of lactoferrin markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of lactoferrins, and conducted various researches on protein components of the fraction.

""Then, they confirmed that, among the aforementioned components, ribonuclease-4 which is a milk protein not having antimicrobial activity by itself, markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of lactoferrin or lactoferrin hydrolysate, and accomplished the present invention.

""As the first aspect, the present invention solving the aforementioned problem provides an antimicrobial activity enhancing agent for lactoferrin or a lactoferrin hydrolysate, which contains ribonuclease-4 as an active ingredient.

""The second aspect of the present invention relates to an antimicrobial composition comprising the antimicrobial activity enhancing agent of the first aspect of the present invention, and one or plural kinds of substances selected from the group consisting of lactoferrin and a lactoferrin hydrolysate, wherein mass ratio of ribonuclease-4 to lactoferrin and a lactoferrin hydrolysate is 1/80 or more.

""The third aspect of the present invention relates to a drug for antimicrobial use comprising the antimicrobial composition of the second aspect of the present invention.

""The fourth aspect of the present invention relates to a food or drink comprising the antimicrobial composition of the second aspect of the present invention.

""The fifth aspect of the present invention relates to a feed comprising the antimicrobial composition of the second aspect of the present invention.

""The sixth aspect of the present invention relates to use of ribonuclease-4 for the production of an antimicrobial activity enhancing agent for lactoferrin or a lactoferrin hydrolysate.

""The seventh aspect of the present invention relates to a method for producing an antimicrobial activity enhancing agent for lactoferrin or a lactoferrin hydrolysate, which comprises:

""(a) the step of contacting raw milk with a cation exchange resin to adsorb proteins in the raw milk to the cation exchange resin, (b) the step of washing the cation exchange resin having undergone the aforementioned adsorption treatment, and flowing an elution solvent to elute a protein fraction having an isoelectric point of 8.0 to 10.0, and (c) the step of subjecting the eluted protein fraction to gel filtration using a gel filtration carrier to collect a fraction of a molecular weight of 30 kDa or less.

The report involved a single event of one patient with end-stage cervical cancer who last received axalimogene filolisbac in early 2013 in an investigator-initiated trial. In late July 2015, the patient was hospitalized for end-stage cervical cancer symptoms. During hospitalization, routine blood cultures were positive for Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). Subsequent analysis determined that it was the highly attenuated strain of Lm used in axalimogene filolisbac which was incapable of causing infection and was highly sensitive to antibiotics. The patient received a course of intravenous antibiotics and was discharged. The patient returned to the hospital in mid-August, approximately two weeks later, with respiratory distress caused by her metastatic disease. The patient passed away later that day. The investigator ruled that the cause of death was due to progression of her cervical cancer.

The company has evaluated this case and agrees with the investigator's conclusion that the cause of death was due to cervical cancer progression. The company believes that axalimogene filolisbac played no role in the patient's death. In investigating this event, Advaxis learned that the patient underwent multiple surgical procedures during the time she was receiving axalimogene filolisbac, including extensive orthopedic reconstruction and receipt of a bone graft and other medical implants. Due to these circumstances, the company believes these implants could have provided a location for axalimogene filolisbac to exist within the body without causing any infection.

Advaxis is working closely with the FDA to facilitate the review and evaluation of this isolated event. The Agency has requested additional information to support a determination that axalimogene filolisbac did not contribute to the patient's death. This additional information has now been provided to the FDA. Advaxis expects that this clinical hold will be resolved expeditiously and without significant interruption to our HPV clinical development program.

Ongoing clinical trials with Advaxis's other product candidates, ADXS-PSA and ADXS-HER2, are not affected by this hold and continue to actively enroll and dose patients.

Conference Call DetailsAdvaxis's management team will host a conference call and webcast at 4:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday, October 6, 2015 to discuss further details of the clinical hold.

About Axalimogene Filolisbac Axalimogene filolisbac (ADXS-HPV) is Advaxis's lead Lm Technology immunotherapy candidate for the treatment of HPV-associated cancers and is in clinical trials for three potential indications: invasive cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, and anal cancer. In a completed randomized Phase 2 study in recurrent/refractory cervical cancer, axalimogene filolisbac showed apparent prolonged survival, objective tumor responses, and a manageable safety profile alone or in combination with chemotherapy, supporting further development of the company's Lm Technology.

About Advaxis, Inc.Located in Princeton, N.J., Advaxis, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multiple cancer immunotherapies based on its proprietary Lm Technology. The Lm Technology, using bioengineered live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) bacteria, is the only known cancer immunotherapy agent shown in preclinical studies to both generate cancer fighting T-cells directed against a cancer antigen and neutralize Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that protect the tumor microenvironment from immunologic attack and contribute to tumor growth. Advaxis's lead Lm Technology immunotherapy, axalimogene filolisbac, targets human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers and is in clinical trials for three potential indications: Phase 2 in invasive cervical cancer, Phase 1/2 in head and neck cancer, and Phase 1/2 in anal cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted axalimogene filolisbac orphan drug designation for each of these three clinical settings. Advaxis has two additional immunotherapy products, ADXS-PSA in prostate cancer and ADXS-HER2 in HER2 expressing solid tumors, in human clinical development.

Subsequent analysis determined that it was the highly attenuated strain of Lm used in axalimogene filolisbac which was incapable of causing infection and was highly sensitive to antibiotics. The patient received a course of intravenous antibiotics and was discharged. The patient returned to the hospital in mid-August, approximately two weeks later, with respiratory distress caused by her metastatic disease. The patient passed away later that day. The investigator ruled that the cause of death was due to progression of her cervical cancer.

The company has evaluated this case and agrees with the investigator's conclusion that the cause of death was due to cervical cancer progression. The company believes that axalimogene filolisbac played no role in the patient's death. In investigating this event, Advaxis learned that the patient underwent multiple surgical procedures during the time she was receiving axalimogene filolisbac, including extensive orthopedic reconstruction and receipt of a bone graft and other medical implants. Due to these circumstances, the company believes these implants could have provided a location for axalimogene filolisbac to exist within the body without causing any infection.

Advaxis is working closely with the FDA to facilitate the review and evaluation of this isolated event. The Agency has requested additional information to support a determination that axalimogene filolisbac did not contribute to the patient's death. This additional information has now been provided to the FDA. Advaxis expects that this clinical hold will be resolved expeditiously and without significant interruption to our HPV clinical development program.

Ongoing clinical trials with Advaxis's other product candidates, ADXS-PSA and ADXS-HER2, are not affected by this hold and continue to actively enroll and dose patients.

Conference Call DetailsAdvaxis's management team will host a conference call and webcast at 4:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday, October 6, 2015 to discuss further details of the clinical hold.

About Axalimogene Filolisbac Axalimogene filolisbac (ADXS-HPV) is Advaxis's lead Lm Technology immunotherapy candidate for the treatment of HPV-associated cancers and is in clinical trials for three potential indications: invasive cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, and anal cancer. In a completed randomized Phase 2 study in recurrent/refractory cervical cancer, axalimogene filolisbac showed apparent prolonged survival, objective tumor responses, and a manageable safety profile alone or in combination with chemotherapy, supporting further development of the company's Lm Technology.

About Advaxis, Inc.Located in Princeton, N.J., Advaxis, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multiple cancer immunotherapies based on its proprietary Lm Technology. The Lm Technology, using bioengineered live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) bacteria, is the only known cancer immunotherapy agent shown in preclinical studies to both generate cancer fighting T-cells directed against a cancer antigen and neutralize Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that protect the tumor microenvironment from immunologic attack and contribute to tumor growth. Advaxis's lead Lm Technology immunotherapy, axalimogene filolisbac, targets human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers and is in clinical trials for three potential indications: Phase 2 in invasive cervical cancer, Phase 1/2 in head and neck cancer, and Phase 1/2 in anal cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted axalimogene filolisbac orphan drug designation for each of these three clinical settings. Advaxis has two additional immunotherapy products, ADXS-PSA in prostate cancer and ADXS-HER2 in HER2 expressing solid tumors, in human clinical development.

Data on Tuesday showed that U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April and small business confidence increased in May - signs that the economy was regaining momentum after stumbling at the start of the year.

""What we've seen is a confirmation that the stock and bond market is dependent on easy monetary policy,"" said James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds in New York.

""The market continues to muddle and is very susceptible to a correction in the case of a shock incident.""

The selloff in U.S. markets spread to the global market, with European shares slipping to a 3-1/2-month low on Tuesday.

Concerns about Greece continued to weigh, with Athens handing its creditors new proposals to unlock funds as time runs out to reach a deal to prevent the country from going bankrupt.

At 12:38 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was up 19.18 points, or 0.11 percent, at 17,785.73 while the S&P 500 was up 2.55 points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,081.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 12.66 points, or 0.25 percent, at 5,008.97.

Six of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the consumer staples index's 0.7 percent rise leading the gains.

Apple fell 0.6 percent to US$126.94, down for the fourth straight session, and was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, a day after the launch of its streaming music service, Apple Music.

Analysts said the new service was unlikely to move the needle on the company's revenue or earnings per share.

Lululemon rose 9.7 percent to US$67.50 after the Canadian yogawear retailer raised its full-year revenue and earnings forecast.

Sage Therapeutics jumped 16 percent to US$87.20 after its experimental injectable drug was found to be effective in treating postpartum depression.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,768 to 1,213. On the Nasdaq, 1,579 issues fell and 1,061 advanced.

534,,DEALNEW020150113eb160000j,1,1.0,1.0,Bayoan,Bayoan,Bayoan,No_by_Default,,,,,,Yes,"That deal followed a Monday announcement that the firm had led a trio of investors in a recapitalization of healthcare IT company Inflexxion Inc., which partners with medical practices to collect and analyze data to help reduce health-related risks, enhance clinical outcomes and positively influence quality of care. One of the company's main focuses is monitoring the use of pain medications and curbing addiction and misuse by providing analytics to physicians and drug companies alike.

""A key element of our strategy is looking at companies where technology and services intersect,"" Periscope principal Steve Jarmel said. ""Inflexxion is about the uniqueness of the offerings, but with SPS, it really came down to the fact that they have the database of who the key [prescription writers] are and can really drill down on who you are trying to market.""

Jarmel said both acquisitions fall in line with recent trends in the healthcare sector that involve companies taking large amounts of data and synthesizing that data into actionable information to help improve efficiencies.

For Inflexxion of Newton, Mass., the Monday deal marks the end of a 15-month auction process that included a range of financial sponsor interest.

According to Michael J. Cassata of Consilium Partners LLC, who advised Inflexxion, his investment banking firm was retained in September 2013 to seek growth capital as well as a liquidity event for Inflexxion co-founder Simon Budman.

While Cassata said the company would have had interest from strategic players, he said his firm only reached out to financial firms.

""We ruled out strategics. We were looking for smart money to develop the company,"" Cassata said. ""The founder did not want to lose the company's identity.""

Following Consilium's retention, Inflexxion signed letters of intent with a number of sponsors in July 2014, eventually closing on the trio of investors led by Periscope, which also included Fidus Investment Corp. (FDUS) of Evanston, Ill., and Chicago's Akoya Capital Partners LLC.

Periscope's Jarmel said his firm looked a number of healthcare IT companies but landed on Inflexxion due to its unique technology and data sets that allow physicians as well as drug companies to see patients' use, or misuse, of opiates.

""It is a very niche industry,"" Jarmel said. ""But [Inflexxion has] real data sets that combine deep scientific understanding with unique and actionable insights that help [healthcare facilities] as well as pharma companies, for instance, track and monitor patients.""

In addition to leading the investment in Inflexxion, Periscope also has brought on Thomas Hegelund, formerly the senior vice president at data analytics company Truven Health Analytics Inc., to take over as president of the company. Akoya Capital managing partner John J. Regazzi, who formerly was CEO of Elsevier Inc., also is joining the board as a director.

Jarmel said Inflexxion would continue to expand both organically and through targeted acquisitions to help it build its offerings into a significant market player. He said, however, that acquisitions also were likely for Strategic Pharma Solutions. He said acquisitions would attempt to add both geographic reach outside the company's core market of Raleigh as well as different services.

Together, the deals mark a continued push by investors to gain a piece of the burgeoning healthcare IT industry that recently has gained a boost from the increased pressure of the federal government for practices to adopt electronic medical records.

""A couple of things have been driving deal activity in the space,"" Cassata explained. ""I think the idea of aggregating data through cloud computing and looking across an entire industry — not just one silo of an industry — has made it possible to look across multiple data sets and has provided a need for companies that can handle large amounts of data and provide real insight on that data.""

In another deal this week, Radnor, Pa., venture capital firm Cross Atlantic Capital Partners on Monday announced it had completed the sale of Health Market Science, a leading supplier of healthcare professional data, to LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a division of Reed Elsevier NV (ENL).

Cross Atlantic first invested in HMS in 2010 during its $6.1 million Series B financing round, joining a group of investors that also included Edison Venture Fund.

Deals in healthcare IT also proliferated 2014, with Cerner Corp.'s (CERN) August deal to acquire Siemens Health Services for $1.3 billion leading the way.

Another notable deal in the space occurred on Nov. 20, when Teaneck, N.J., IT services company Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH) closed its acquisition of TriZetto Corp., creating a fully integrated healthcare technology and operations leader. Cognizant paid roughly $2 billion to TriZetto's owners, led by private equity firm Apax Partners.

Another company, Nasdaq-listed MedAssets Inc. (MDAS), also has been acquisitive. On Aug. 13, the Atlanta company completed a $142 million acquisition of SG-2 LLC, a provider of healthcare business intelligence.

Finally, in December The Deal reported that Strata Decision Technology LLC, a Chicago healthcare IT company, was in its second round of bids in a sale process led by TripleTree LLC. A deal has yet to materialize.

Jarmel said Periscope retained Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP for legal advice on both the Inflexxion and Strategic Pharma Solutions transactions. He declined to name terms for either transaction, but according to Periscope's website, the firm typically invests in companies with $2 million to $5 million of Ebitda.

6:00 EDT - After a third-straight week of declines for the Dow and S&P, US stock-index futures start this week solidly in the green amid gains in Europe and Asia thanks to hopes that China will open the spigot if need be to further support that country's slowing economy. A potential hard landing there has long been a point of worry for investors, helped on by what some have thought is slow action thus far on the part of Chinese policy makers to buck up the economy. But comments over the weekend that despite what's happened help is available if need be soothes some concerns. S&P 500 futures are up 9 points. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

Sterne Agee thinks, ""Measured 2016 production growth likely reflects the company's decision to manage its [free-cash-flow] deficit in '15 amid weak natural-gas prices and weak regional gas prices."" The investment bank remains bullish on CNX, which is also a coal miner, on valuation reasons and thinks that should normalize when natural-gas and coal prices improve. But some have been waiting years on that, and both remain soft. CNX is down 18% this month.

6:00 EDT - After a third-straight week of declines for the Dow and S&P, US stock-index futures start this week solidly in the green amid gains in Europe and Asia thanks to hopes that China will open the spigot if need be to further support that country's slowing economy. A potential hard landing there has long been a point of worry for investors, helped on by what some have thought is slow action thus far on the part of Chinese policy makers to buck up the economy. But comments over the weekend that despite what's happened help is available if need be soothes some concerns. S&P 500 futures are up 9 points. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

SAN FRANCISCO, May 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Medizone International, Inc. (The Company) (MZEI:OB, MZEI:QB), manufacturers of the AsepticSure(R) Hospital Disinfection System, have recently announced that the same biological indicators used to confirm medical instrument sterilization in autoclaves, may also be used to confirm absolute bactericidal kill for hospital room disinfection.

Biological indicators are considered the only process indicators that can directly monitor the lethality of a given cleaning process and are recommended by the FDA for all autoclave usage. Spore test strips have now become the reference standard for routine quality assurance of hospital instrument sterilization and, according to the FDA, they should be utilized with each autoclave load.

In laboratory testing Medizone has discovered that the same spore test strips are completely inactivated (killed) when placed in a room during an AsepticSure run. Over twenty-five runs have now been completed using two different commonly used types of spore test strips and in each case the results have been the same. During testing, spore test strips that were placed under beds, on the floor, on walls and behind objects are completely deactivated 100% of the time. The implications of this finding are profound in that our AsepticSure Hospital Disinfection System can now demonstrate via independent, internationally recognized testing processes, a level of decontamination previously not considered achievable outside of an autoclave.

Hospital testing is confirming that once an isolation room has been disinfected with the AsepticSure process, the ""sick room cycle"" is broken, and no new infections will be generated from that room for significant periods of time. This has proven true for MRSA (staph infections), C.difficile and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The AsepticSure process is demonstrating a previously unobtainable level of hospital room disinfection within normal workflows while obtaining real reductions in new hospital associated infection rates. AsepticSure is the only hospital disinfection system that can guarantee a greater than 6-log (>99.9999%) kill of infective pathogens throughout the entire room, and now independently verify it with the same testing products used to confirm instrument sterilization in autoclaves.

This Press Release may contain certain forward looking statements that could involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the results of ongoing clinical studies, economic conditions, product and technology development, production efficiencies, product demand, competitive products, competitive environment, successful testing and government regulatory issues. Additional risks are identified in the company's filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., June 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that Bayer HealthCare's Japanese subsidiary, Bayer Yakuhin, Ltd., received approval for EYLEA(R) (aflibercept) Injection by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan for the treatment of patients with macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO). This new indication includes macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) in addition to the previously-approved indication of macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).

The approval is based on positive results from the double-masked, randomized, active-controlled phase 3 VIBRANT study in patients with visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to BRVO. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who gained at least 15 letters in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline at week 24, as measured on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS) eye chart, a standard chart used in research to measure visual acuity. More than half of the patients who were treated with aflibercept solution for injection gained at least three lines of vision.

Bayer HealthCare and Regeneron are collaborating on the global development of EYLEA. Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA in the United States. Bayer HealthCare licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside the United States, where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA, except for Japan where Regeneron receives a percentage of net sales.

About Retinal Vein Occlusion

RVO is a significant cause of vision impairment and a chronic disease that requires early and ongoing management to obtain the best possible vision.

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) includes branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). RVO is a chronic eye condition that can lead to sudden vision loss and is second only to diabetic retinopathy as the most frequent cause of visual loss from diseases affecting the blood vessels of the retina. While each patient experiences RVO differently, all patients are at risk for vision loss which can impact their ability to participate in everyday activities and may cause significant financial burden to patients, their families as well as broader society. RVO has a significant global impact with an estimated 16.4 million people affected worldwide, including around 13.9 million with BRVO and 2.5 million with CRVO.

RVO is the result of a blockage in a blood vessel of the retina, the light sensitive part of the eye. In CRVO, the blockage occurs in the main retinal vein at the optic nerve. In BRVO, the blockage occurs in one of the branch retinal veins. If a blockage in any of the retinal veins (central or branch) is not resolved, it can result in a number of complications. The most common reason for vision impairment in patients with RVO is macular edema, swelling of the macula, which is the central portion of the retina responsible for seeing fine details.

About EYLEA(R) for Intravitreal Injection

EYLEA is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor formulated as an injection for the eye. EYLEA is designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels (vascular permeability) in the eye by blocking VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PLGF), two growth factors involved in angiogenesis. EYLEA helps prevent VEGF-A and PLGF from interacting with their natural VEGF receptors as shown in preclinical studies.

IMPORTANT PRESCRIBING INFORMATION FOR EYLEA(R) (aflibercept) INJECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

EYLEA(R) (aflibercept) Injection is a prescription medicine approved for the treatment of patients with:

Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD): The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg administered by injection in the eye every 2 months (8 weeks) following 3 initial monthly (4 weeks) injections. EYLEA may be dosed once per month, but additional benefit was not seen with this dosing plan.

Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO): The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg administered by injection in the eye monthly (every 4 weeks).

Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in patients with DME: The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg administered by injection in the eye every 2 months (8 weeks) following 5 initial monthly (4 weeks) injections. EYLEA may be dosed once per month, but additional benefit was not seen with this dosing plan.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR EYLEA(R) (aflibercept) INJECTION

EYLEA(R) (aflibercept) Injection is a prescription medication administered by injection into the eye. You should not use EYLEA if you have an infection in or around the eye, eye pain or redness, or known allergies to any of the ingredients in EYLEA, including aflibercept. As with all medications, EYLEA can cause side effects.

Injection into the eye can result in an infection in the eye and retinal detachment. Inflammation in the eye has been reported with the use of EYLEA.

In some patients, injections with EYLEA may trigger a temporary increase in eye pressure within 1 hour of the injection. Sustained increases in eye pressure have been reported with repeated injections and your doctor may monitor this after each injection.

There is a potential risk of serious and sometimes fatal side effects related to blood clots, leading to heart attack or stroke in patients receiving EYLEA.

The most common side effects reported in patients receiving EYLEA are increased redness in the eye, eye pain, cataract, moving spots in the field of vision, increased pressure in the eye and vitreous (gel-like substance) detachment.

Serious side effects related to the injection procedure are rare but can occur including infection inside the eye, retinal detachment, cataract, increased pressure in the eye, and vitreous detachment. It is important that you contact your doctor right away if you think you might be experiencing any side effects.

EYLEA is for prescription use only. For additional safety information, please talk to your doctor and see the full Prescribing Information for EYLEA.

The company continues to advance its well-established leadership position in hematology and immunology and seeks to expand its oncology portfolio for patients with limited treatment options. Baxalta plans to launch 20 new products by 2020, leveraging the company's experienced leadership team, existing global capabilities and footprint in more than 100 countries. As of today, Baxalta begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""BXLT"".

""Baxalta launches with a rich heritage in pioneering innovations and strategic partnerships, which positions us well to continue to develop transformative therapies. What sets us apart is our uncompromising focus on understanding patients' needs and experiences every step of the way,"" said Ludwig Hantson, chief executive officer and president, Baxalta Incorporated. ""We are leveraging science and external innovation to spark discovery and work with all stakeholders -- patients, healthcare professionals and policymakers - to ensure access and improve standards of care.""

Robust Portfolio of Differentiated Brands to Treat Complex Diseases

Baxalta offers a diverse and differentiated portfolio of trusted brands. The company has pioneered several innovations in recombinant protein therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders, and was the first to make human plasma available for treatment. Over the past two years, Baxalta has received seven new approvals and currently has four products under regulatory review across its three areas of focus.

In hematology, the company is advancing its leadership position with sustainable growth of on-market products, including ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)] and FEIBA [Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Complex (Human)]. Baxalta is also bringing next-generation products, including BAX 855, an investigational extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A to be marketed in the United States under the brand name ADYNOVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Pegylated].

In immunology, Baxalta expects to capitalize on its broad and differentiated immune globulin portfolio with the successful launch of HYQVIA [Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (human) with Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase], an innovative therapy for the treatment of adults with primary immunodeficiency.

In oncology, the company's late-stage pipeline capitalizes on its expertise and capabilities in rare diseases and complex therapeutics to address patients with high unmet need and difficult-to-treat cancers including myelofibrosis, a rare blood cancer, and metastatic pancreatic cancer. In addition, Baxalta recently announced the acquisition of the ONCASPAR(R) (pegaspargase) product portfolio for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is expected to close in the second half of 2015.

Growth through Patient-Focused Innovation Strategy

Baxalta continues to transform its innovation strategy and has shifted its investments toward new external partnerships and flexible models to accelerate drug discovery and development. World-class scientists, advanced technology platforms and a patient-focused model that examines the underlying biology of disease to define novel mechanisms of actions are at the core of Baxalta's R&D model. The company has more than 40 programs in development, 13 of which are in late-stage development.

Baxalta is advancing several breakthrough innovations that have the potential to transform the way hemophilia patients are treated. The company is currently advancing a Phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial assessing the safety and optimal dosing level of an investigational factor IX (FIX) gene therapy treatment for hemophilia B that has the potential to redefine the treatment of hemophilia by providing a mechanism for the patient's own liver to begin producing FIX over an extended period.

The company also recently acquired novel technology platforms in the fields of immunology and hematology, including the acquisition of SuppreMol for autoimmune and allergic diseases and AesRx for sickle cell disease. Baxalta continues to expand its oncology pipeline through strategic partnerships, such as its partnership with Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Merrimack's New Drug Application for MM-398 (irinotecan liposome injection) or ""nal-IRI"" for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have been previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy was recently accepted for review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and granted Priority Review status, and in parallel, an application for European approval is under review by the European Medicines Agency.

The Promise of the Baxalta Spark

Baxalta has embarked on a transformational journey to build an organization and culture where improving patients' lives is at the center of the company strategy, values and behaviors.

""Baxalta has a renewed energy, as individuals and teams focus on accelerating innovation and access to our therapies while listening to and understanding our patients and the people who serve them on their journey,"" said Hantson. ""We are building a purpose-driven culture, one where employees and partners are empowered to contribute new ideas that will deliver strong performance for shareholders, breakthrough therapies and personalized services for patients, and meaningful and sustained value for all stakeholders.""

The company continues to advance its well-established leadership position in hematology and immunology and seeks to expand its oncology portfolio for patients with limited treatment options. Baxalta plans to launch 20 new products by 2020, leveraging the company's experienced leadership team, existing global capabilities and footprint in more than 100 countries. As of today, Baxalta begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""BXLT"".

""Baxalta launches with a rich heritage in pioneering innovations and strategic partnerships, which positions us well to continue to develop transformative therapies. What sets us apart is our uncompromising focus on understanding patients' needs and experiences every step of the way,"" said Ludwig Hantson, chief executive officer and president, Baxalta Incorporated. ""We are leveraging science and external innovation to spark discovery and work with all stakeholders -- patients, healthcare professionals and policymakers - to ensure access and improve standards of care.""

Robust Portfolio of Differentiated Brands to Treat Complex Diseases

Baxalta offers a diverse and differentiated portfolio of trusted brands. The company has pioneered several innovations in recombinant protein therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders, and was the first to make human plasma available for treatment. Over the past two years, Baxalta has received seven new approvals and currently has four products under regulatory review across its three areas of focus.

In hematology, the company is advancing its leadership position with sustainable growth of on-market products, including ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)] and FEIBA [Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Complex (Human)]. Baxalta is also bringing next-generation products, including BAX 855, an investigational extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A to be marketed in the United States under the brand name ADYNOVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Pegylated].

In immunology, Baxalta expects to capitalize on its broad and differentiated immune globulin portfolio with the successful launch of HYQVIA [Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (human) with Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase], an innovative therapy for the treatment of adults with primary immunodeficiency.

In oncology, the company's late-stage pipeline capitalizes on its expertise and capabilities in rare diseases and complex therapeutics to address patients with high unmet need and difficult-to-treat cancers including myelofibrosis, a rare blood cancer, and metastatic pancreatic cancer. In addition, Baxalta recently announced the acquisition of the ONCASPAR(R) (pegaspargase) product portfolio for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is expected to close in the second half of 2015.

Growth through Patient-Focused Innovation Strategy

Baxalta continues to transform its innovation strategy and has shifted its investments toward new external partnerships and flexible models to accelerate drug discovery and development. World-class scientists, advanced technology platforms and a patient-focused model that examines the underlying biology of disease to define novel mechanisms of actions are at the core of Baxalta's R&D model. The company has more than 40 programs in development, 13 of which are in late-stage development.

Baxalta is advancing several breakthrough innovations that have the potential to transform the way hemophilia patients are treated. The company is currently advancing a Phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial assessing the safety and optimal dosing level of an investigational factor IX (FIX) gene therapy treatment for hemophilia B that has the potential to redefine the treatment of hemophilia by providing a mechanism for the patient's own liver to begin producing FIX over an extended period.

The company also recently acquired novel technology platforms in the fields of immunology and hematology, including the acquisition of SuppreMol for autoimmune and allergic diseases and AesRx for sickle cell disease. Baxalta continues to expand its oncology pipeline through strategic partnerships, such as its partnership with Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Merrimack's New Drug Application for MM-398 (irinotecan liposome injection) or ""nal-IRI"" for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have been previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy was recently accepted for review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and granted Priority Review status, and in parallel, an application for European approval is under review by the European Medicines Agency.

The Promise of the Baxalta Spark

Baxalta has embarked on a transformational journey to build an organization and culture where improving patients' lives is at the center of the company strategy, values and behaviors.

""Baxalta has a renewed energy, as individuals and teams focus on accelerating innovation and access to our therapies while listening to and understanding our patients and the people who serve them on their journey,"" said Hantson. ""We are building a purpose-driven culture, one where employees and partners are empowered to contribute new ideas that will deliver strong performance for shareholders, breakthrough therapies and personalized services for patients, and meaningful and sustained value for all stakeholders.""

The FDA has contended that such off-label marketing isn't lawful, but recent court decisions have held that the First Amendment restricts the FDA's power to limit truthful speech.

U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ruled that Amarin ""may engage in truthful and non-misleading speech promoting the off-label use of Vascepa."" More specifically, he ruled, disseminating such information cannot serve as the basis for the FDA or the government to charge the company and its sales personnel. He said the First Amendment allows the company to make such statements, if they are truthful and not misleading.

The FDA has long insisted that companies break the law if they attempt to market a drug for a purpose not approved by the agency.

Vascepa was approved in July 2012 for people with ""severe"" high levels of triglycerides in their blood. The company has sought FDA approval of the drug to treat somewhat lower, but still elevated, levels of the fats. That use is at issue in the New York case.

The Justice Department has successfully extracted billions of dollars in settlements from companies that were found to promote their drugs beyond their approved use. The Vascepa ruling, while only by one district court, could change the future of such cases.

Alan Bennett, an attorney with the firm Ropes & Gray in Washington, D.C., said the decision ""underscores the need for the FDA to rethink and make changes in how it regulates medical information. This is just the latest court decision that challenges the underlying policies of the regulatory oversight system.""

Mr. Bennett, who represents a wide range of pharmaceutical companies, said he expects the decision to ""expedite review"" by the FDA of its policy.

Amarin was represented by Floyd Abrams, the renowned First Amendment lawyer with the firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel.

""The FDA and the Department of Justice are certainly on notice now as to what the law is in this area,"" Mr. Abrams said.

The FDA and Justice Department both declined to comment.

The FDA had said in a letter to the pharmaceutical industry in June 2014 that it would be issuing a guidance about what its new standards are for promoting medical products. But it hasn't issued such a guidance since then.

The Amarin case follows a similar one decided in January 2013, in which the government had sought to prosecute a drug-company salesman, Alfred Caronia. Mr. Caronia had been convicted of marketing a narcolepsy drug for drowsiness and chronic fatigue—purposes not approved by the FDA.

The federal appellate court in Brooklyn, N.Y., said the FDA's regulation of such marketing was a violation of Mr. Caronia's free-speech rights. The FDA didn't appeal that decision.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Sept. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: RIGL) announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug designation to Fostamatinib, Rigel's oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor which is currently in Phase 3 clinical studies in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Rigel's Phase 3 program for Fostamatinib in ITP, called FIT, has surpassed the half-way point in enrollment and Rigel expects the program to read out results in mid-2016.

""Receiving this Orphan Drug designation from the FDA is a positive step forward in the development of Fostamatinib,"" said Raul Rodriguez, president and chief executive officer of Rigel. ""We look forward to completing our Phase 3 program and intend to file a New Drug Application for Fostamatinib in ITP in the U.S.,"" he added.

Fostamatinib and ITP

In patients with ITP, the immune system attacks and destroys the body's own blood platelets, which play an active role in blood clotting and healing. ITP patients can suffer extraordinary bruising, bleeding and fatigue as a result of low platelet counts. Current therapies for ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPOs) and splenectomy. Rigel believes that Fostamatinib may address the autoimmune basis of the disease.

Orphan Drug Designation

Orphan Drug designation is granted to compounds that are in development for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. This designation can provide numerous benefits to the companies developing these drugs for these indications, including possibly a market exclusivity period, tax credits, waived FDA fees and research and development grants and others.

About Rigel (www.rigel.com)

Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of novel, small-molecule drugs for the treatment of immune diseases and cancers. Rigel's pioneering research focuses on signaling pathways that are critical to disease mechanisms. Rigel currently has the following product candidates in development: Fostamatinib, an oral SYK inhibitor, which is in Phase 3 clinical trials for ITP and a Phase 2 clinical trial for IgA nephropathy (IgAN); R348, a topical ophthalmic JAK/SYK inhibitor, in a Phase 2 clinical trial for dry eye in ocular graft-versus-host disease (GvHD); two oncology product candidates in Phase 1 development with partners BerGenBio AG and Daiichi Sankyo; and two preclinical programs with partners AstraZeneca, for R256 in asthma, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, for TGF beta inhibitors in immuno-oncology.

This release contains forward-looking statements relating to, among other things, the results of Rigel's Phase 3 clinical studies with Fostamatinib in ITP, the potential filing and timing of filing of a New Drug Application for Fostamatinib and Rigel's product pipeline and development programs.

S&P's Amy Martin said subprime loans represent a lower percentage of originations compared to last cycle, and independent finance companies that have come lately to the auto-loan market may find themselves struggling as interest rates go up. But the number of off-lease vehicles is expected to rise in the coming years, which should help moderate valuations. Dealers also appear to be in much better shape than during 2007/08, though participants disagreed on whether there is more pent-up demand in the consumer market.

10:50 ET - Why not make it bigger? Investors are wildly cheering news of a megamerger between DOW and DuPont (DD) with historic stock gains. DOW jumps 11%, or some $5.50/share. According to FactSet, the stock has never added more than $3.42 in a single session (data are adjusted for stock splits) since at least 1972 and hasn't had a double-digit percentage gain since 2009. Meanwhile, DD's best gain in FactSet's records is $5.17; the stock is up $8.24, or 12%. The percentage jump would also be the biggest since at least 1972, and the stock has only logged 3 double-digit gains the past 43 years, led by an 11.5% jump in 2008. (david.benoit@wsj.com; @DaveCBenoit)

10:48 ET - Textron (TXT) remains bullish on prospects for its homegrown Scorpion combat jet, even though the Pentagon has so far declined to bite on the low-cost plane. TXT says the addressable market could exceed 1,000 planes, split between 10-15 potential buyers. Crucially, it's reached a deal with the Pentagon to certify the plane even if the US military isn't buying, a stamp of approval that would help export sales. The first-production aircraft is due to fly next summer. TXT recently up 2.2% at $42.10, ahead of the broader aerospace market. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

10:39 ET - John Arnold made billions in the energy market with bets on natural gas prices, first at Enron and then at his hedge fund Centaurus Energy. He retired in 2012 while still in his 30s and now channels his work through a foundation focused on crime reduction, education improvement and pharmaceutical-pricing reform. But he is still closely followed by people in the energy industry, and a tweet from his account Tuesday got some attention. He said: ""With few hedges for '16, half of US energy industry will be bankrupt in 6 months with prices at these levels. OPEC definitely smells blood."" (christian.berthelsen@wsj.com)

10:29 ET - Fitch sees stability in the US auto sector for 2016 on ""modest global"" sales growth. This as the ratings agency likes the steps most companies have taken to improve their balance sheets while injecting more flexibility into operations. It thinks US light-vehicle sales should come in around 17.5M in 2016, versus Fitch's 2015 view of 17.2M. But it could be on the wrong side of the guessing game at least for this year as many in the auto industry are now calling for 17.4M if December stays hot. (jeff.bennett@wsj.com)

10:24 ET - Stocks have entered a ""mature phase,"" which means the days of double-digit returns are likely a thing of the past, according to Deutsche Bank's wealth-management business. ""2016 and beyond should only yield mid-single-digit total returns,"" writes Henning Gebhardt, global head of equities, in the annual outlook. ""At the same time, we have to acknowledge a higher risk that annual returns could easily turn negative."" The group sees little room for valuations to move higher and future returns to be built on ""moderate earnings growth and dividends."" (dan.strumpf@wsj.com)

10:24 ET - Employee error is the most common reason for a data breach at companies, according to a cybersecurity report by the Association of Corporate Counsel. The report, which contained survey responses from more than 1,000 in-house lawyers in 30 countries, found that 30% of breaches this year occurred as a result of employee error, such as accidentally sending an email with sensitive information to someone outside the company. Other common reasons for a breach included unauthorized access by insiders intending to steal company data and phishing attacks, when third parties send emails designed to trick employees into giving up their personal information. (Nicole.hong@wsj.com)

10:23 ET - Now that Kinder Morgan (KMI) has cut its dividend, MLP investors may be wondering who's next. Though KMI is no longer set up as a partnership, it pioneered a structure now common for pipeline companies and known for paying out large amounts of cash to investors. CEO Steven Kean tells WSJ the model is still a good one--even though it's not working at the moment. ""I think generally the idea of distributing to shareholders the cash that you generate for your business and raising the capital to expand the business is a pretty good model. However it doesn't work in the capital market where the cost of capital escalates the way it has in today's equity markets."" (alison.sider@wsj.com; @alyrose)

10:21 ET - Most, but not all, analysts expect the Bank of Mexico to follow any Fed interest-rate increase next week by raising its own 3% overnight rate. ""Although it will be a close call, we are sticking with our nonconsensus view that the Mexican central bank will leave rates unchanged this month even if the Fed raises rates,"" says Capital Economics. Barclays has a similar view, sticking to its call that the central bank will stay on hold, and that only ""a very-violent market reaction might force the Bank of Mexico to react."" Annual CPI slowed to 2.21% in November, the lowest on records since 1970. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)

10:19 ET - How much might DOW pay to combine with chemical rival DuPont (DD)? Jefferies thinks DOW could offer as much as $78/share and still argue the deal is a good one. That price would be 17% above yesterday's close. But don't expect this to be the last word on chemical-industry dealmaking. WSJ's report of the talks could spur seed-and-pesticide maker Syngenta (SYNN.VX) to step up quickly with a competing offer for DD or prompt renewed talks with Monsanto (MON), the investment bank muses. And if DOW and DD do go forward, the reshuffling isn't like to end soon as plans to integrate and then split up the combined company could be a lengthy process--taking up to 5 years in Jefferies' estimation. Both stocks are up 11%, with DOW hitting a fresh record high. (alison.sider@wsj.com; @alyrose)

""Somatuline(R) is the first and only treatment with a statistically significant progression-free survival benefit approved by the FDA for patients as an antitumor therapy in the treatment of gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. This is a significant step forward in our mission to develop and deliver innovative therapies to treat serious illnesses.""

The approval of Somatuline(R) was based on a 96-week landmark registrational Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (CLARINET(R)) of 204 patients enrolled in 48 centers across 14 countries. The trial showed that Somatuline(R) reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 53% versus placebo in patients with advanced gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (p<0.001). Safety data generated from the Phase III study were consistent with the known safety profile of Somatuline(R). The rates of discontinuation due to treatment-emergent adverse reactions were 5% (5/101 patients) in the Somatuline(R) arm and 3% (3/103 patients) in the placebo arm.

Gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are rare, but serious cancers. There are an estimated 112,000 individuals currently living with neuroendocrine tumors in the U.S., and the incidence and prevalence of this type of cancer have risen 4-to-6 fold in the last 30 years. Furthermore, up to ninety percent of patients are incorrectly diagnosed, many for more than 5 years, meaning that they are often diagnosed at a late stage. During this process, patients may be misdiagnosed with other gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease.

""Somatuline(R) is the first somatostatin analog to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival, a clinically significant endpoint in oncology which measures how long the patient continues to live with the disease without it getting any worse,"" said Dr. Alexandria Phan, Director of GI Medical Oncology at Houston Methodist. ""Somatuline(R) offers a new weapon in our fight against this deadly disease."" Maryann Wahmann, President of the Neuroendocrine Cancer Awareness Network and a Carcinoid Cancer Patient added, ""As a patient who also started an advocacy group for this community, I know first-hand how important it is to have a new treatment option with anticancer benefits for neuroendocrine tumors.""

Somatuline(R) will be delivered via a newly approved, ready-to-use, prefilled syringe which incorporates Safe'n'Sound(R) technology, including a retractable needle guard to help avoid needle sticks, and it is manufactured without latex or natural dry rubber. The new delivery device does not require reconstitution and is a low volume (0.5 mL) deep subcutaneous injection offering a streamlined process that supports full dose delivery. About Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, also known as gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, are a rare type of cancer. It is diagnosed in approximately 5 out of every 100,000 people in the U.S. The average time until a GEP-NET patient is accurately diagnosed is at least 5 years; with more than 80% of patients seeing at least three doctors prior to their diagnosis. Because of this, most patients are diagnosed while in the advanced stages of the disease, which often leads to a poor prognosis. Additionally, the symptoms of GEP-NETs are gastrointestinal in nature, thus they can be misdiagnosed as Crohn's disease or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). About the Phase III Study The approval of Somatuline(R) Depot(R) in gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors is based on a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (CLARINET(R)) of lanreotide's antiproliferative response in patients with enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00353496). This 96-week multinational study was conducted in collaboration with the UK & Ireland Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (UKI NETS) and the European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS).

A total of 204 patients from 48 centers across 14 countries with well or moderately differentiated non-functioning enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and a proliferation index (Ki67) of <10%, were randomized to treatment with Somatuline(R)Depot(R) 120 mg (n=101) or placebo (n=103). At enrollment, primary tumor locations were pancreas (45%), midgut (36%), hindgut (7%) and unknown (13%). Most patients had stable disease (96%) and were treatment-naive (84%). Thirty percent of patients had a Ki67 of 3% to <=10% (WHO grade 2) and 33% had an hepatic tumor load >25%.

The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survivial (defined as time to either disease progression (centrally assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, RECIST 1.0) or death). Two baseline computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans (12 to 24 weeks) were performed, followed by additional scans at 12- week intervals during the first year and 24-week intervals during the second year up to 96 weeks.

The data showed that placebo-treated patients had a median PFS of 16.6 months and 33.0% had not progressed or died at 96 weeks, whereas the median PFS for Somatuline(R) treated patients was not reached and will be greater than 22 months and 65.1% had not progressed or died at 96 weeks (stratified logrank test, p<0.001). This represented a 53% reduction in risk of disease progression or death with Somatuline(R) Depot compared to placebo, based on a hazard ratio of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.30-0.73). These statistically and clinically significant antiproliferative effects of Somatuline(R) Depot(R) were observed in a large population of patients with grade G1 or G2 (World Health Organization classification) GEP-NETs, and independent of hepatic tumor volume (<=25% or >25%). Overall survival and quality of life measures were not different between Somatuline(R) and placebo groups. Safety data generated from the study are consistent with the known safety profile of Somatuline(R). Indication: Somatuline(R) Depot(R) (lanreotide) Injection 120 mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, well- or moderately differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors to improve progression-free survival. Important Safety Information Contraindications: Somatuline(R) is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to lanreotide or related peptides. Warnings and Precautions: Somatuline may reduce gallbladder motility and lead to gallstone formation. Periodic monitoring may be needed.

Patients may experience hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Glucose level monitoring is recommended and antidiabetic treatment adjusted accordingly.

Somatuline may decrease heart rate. In patients treated for GEP-NETs, the incidence of heart rate < 60 bpm was 23% with Somatuline vs 16% with placebo. Incidence of heart rate < 50 bpm or bradycardia was 1% in each group.

Somatuline may decrease bioavailability of cyclosporine. Cyclosporine dose may need to be adjusted. Adverse Reactions: In the GEP-NET pivotal trial, the most common adverse reactions (incidence >10% and more common than placebo) in patients treated with Somatuline(R) Depot(R) vs placebo were abdominal pain (34% vs 24%), musculoskeletal pain (19% vs 13%), vomiting (19% vs 9%), headache (16% vs 11%), injection site reaction (15% vs 7%), hyperglycemia (14% vs 5%), hypertension (14% vs 5%), and cholelithiasis (14% vs 7%).

""This recommendation for approval in Europe, the second indication for Jakavi and many months ahead of schedule, is further evidence that our innovative scientific advances can offer significant benefit to patients.""

Under the Incyte-Novartis Collaboration and License Agreement signed in 2009, Novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib outside of the United States for all hematologic and oncologic indications, and sells ruxolitinib under the name Jakavi. Ruxolitinib is marketed by Incyte in the United States as Jakafi(R) (ruxolitinib). About Polycythemia Vera Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and is typically characterized by elevated hematocrit, the volume percentage of red blood cells in whole blood, which can lead to a thickening of the blood and an increased risk of blood clots, as well as an elevated white blood cell and platelet count1. Patients with PV who fail to consistently maintain appropriate blood count levels, including appropriate hematocrit levels, have an approximately four times higher risk of major thrombosis (blood clots) or cardiovascular death2. Patients with PV can also suffer from an enlarged spleen and a significant symptom burden which may be attributed to thickening of the blood and lack of oxygen to parts of the body3. These symptoms commonly include fatigue, itching, night sweats, bone pain, fever, and weight loss4.

Approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. are living with PV5. Current standard treatment for PV is phlebotomy (the removal of blood from the body) plus aspirin. When phlebotomy can no longer control PV, chemotherapy such as hydroxyurea, or interferon, is utilized4,6. Approximately one in four patients with PV are considered uncontrolled7,8 because they have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of PV.

About Jakafi(R) (ruxolitinib) Jakafi is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of people with polycythemia vera (PV) who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea.

Jakafi is also indicated for treatment of people with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post-polycythemia vera MF, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF.

Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi(R) (ruxolitinib) outside the United States. Important Safety Information Jakafi can cause serious side effects, including: Low blood counts: Jakafi may cause your platelet, red blood cell, or white blood cell counts to be lowered. If you develop bleeding, stop taking Jakafi and call your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will perform blood tests to check your blood counts before you start Jakafi and regularly during your treatment. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of Jakafi or stop your treatment based on the results of your blood tests. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you experience unusual bleeding, bruising, fatigue, shortness of breath, or a fever. Infection: You may be at risk for developing a serious infection during treatment with Jakafi. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop any of the following symptoms of infection: chills, nausea, vomiting, aches, weakness, fever, painful skin rash or blisters. Skin cancers: Some people who take Jakafi have developed certain types of non-melanoma skin cancers. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop any new or changing skin lesions. The most common side effects of Jakafi include: anemia, low platelet count, bruising, dizziness, headache.

These are not all the possible side effects of Jakafi. Ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for more information. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.

Before taking Jakafi, tell your healthcare provider about all the medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements you are taking and all your medical conditions, including if you have an infection, have or had tuberculosis (TB), or have been in close contact with someone who has TB, have or had liver or kidney problems, are on dialysis, had skin cancer or have any other medical condition. Take Jakafi exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Do not change or stop taking Jakafi without first talking to your healthcare provider. Do not drink grapefruit juice while on Jakafi.

Women should not take Jakafi while pregnant or planning to become pregnant, or if breast-feeding. Please see the Full Prescribing Information available at www.jakafi.com, which includes a more complete discussion of the risks associated with Jakafi. References 1 Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.

""This recommendation for approval in Europe, the second indication for Jakavi and many months ahead of schedule, is further evidence that our innovative scientific advances can offer significant benefit to patients.""

Under the Incyte-Novartis Collaboration and License Agreement signed in 2009, Novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib outside of the United States for all hematologic and oncologic indications, and sells ruxolitinib under the name Jakavi. Ruxolitinib is marketed by Incyte in the United States as Jakafi(R) (ruxolitinib). About Polycythemia Vera Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and is typically characterized by elevated hematocrit, the volume percentage of red blood cells in whole blood, which can lead to a thickening of the blood and an increased risk of blood clots, as well as an elevated white blood cell and platelet count1. Patients with PV who fail to consistently maintain appropriate blood count levels, including appropriate hematocrit levels, have an approximately four times higher risk of major thrombosis (blood clots) or cardiovascular death2. Patients with PV can also suffer from an enlarged spleen and a significant symptom burden which may be attributed to thickening of the blood and lack of oxygen to parts of the body3. These symptoms commonly include fatigue, itching, night sweats, bone pain, fever, and weight loss4.

Approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. are living with PV5. Current standard treatment for PV is phlebotomy (the removal of blood from the body) plus aspirin. When phlebotomy can no longer control PV, chemotherapy such as hydroxyurea, or interferon, is utilized4,6. Approximately one in four patients with PV are considered uncontrolled7,8 because they have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of PV.

I-STOP revolutionized the way controlled substances are prescribed, distributed and tracked in New York State.

I-STOP allows for a ""real time"" prescription monitoring registry to provide timely and enhanced information to practitioners and pharmacists. Other reforms include requiring all prescriptions to be electronically transmitted; improving safeguards for the distribution of specific prescription controlled substances that are prone to abuse; and requiring the Department of Health to establish a safe disposal program for unused medications.

By joining the NABP PMP InterConnect hub, prescribers and pharmacists using New York's prescription monitoring program will soon have have access to the databases of more than 30 other states currently using the InterConnect hub.

""Rapid removal of body fat is an age-old ideal, and many substances have been claimed to accomplish such results, although few have shown results. 'Mesotherapy', or the use of injectables for the removal of fat, is not widely accepted among medical practitioners due to safety and efficacy concerns, although homeopathic and cosmetic claims have been made since the 1950's. Mesotherapy was originally conceived in Europe as a method of utilizing cutaneous injections containing a mixture of compounds for the treatment of local medical and cosmetic conditions. Although mesotherapy was traditionally employed for pain relief, its cosmetic applications, particularly fat and cellulite removal, have recently received attention in the United States. One such reported treatment for localized fat reduction, which was popularized in Brazil and uses injections of phosphatidylcholine, has been erroneously considered synonymous with mesotherapy. Despite its attraction as a purported 'fat-dissolving' injection, the safety and efficacy of these cosmetic treatments remain ambiguous to most patients and physicians. See, Rotunda, A. M. and M. Kolodney, Dermatologic Surgery 32: 465-480 (2006) ('Mesotherapy and Phosphatidylcholine Injections: Historical Clarification and Review').

""Recently published literature reports that the bile acid deoxycholic acid has fat removing properties when injected into fatty deposits in vivo. See, WO 2005/117900 and WO 2005/112942, as well as US2005/0261258; US2005/0267080; US2006/127468; and US20060154906, all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety including figures). Deoxycholate injected into fat tissue has the effects of: 1) degrading fat cells via a cytolytic mechanism; and 2) causing skin tightening. Both of these effects are required to mediate the desired aesthetic corrections (i.e., body contouring). Because deoxycholate injected into fat is rapidly inactivated by exposure to protein and then rapidly returns to the intestinal contents, its effects are spatially contained. As a result of this attenuation effect that confers clinical safety, fat removal therapies typically require 4-6 sessions. This localized fat removal without the need for surgery is beneficial not only for therapeutic treatment relating to pathological localized fat deposits (e.g., dyslipidemias incident to medical intervention in the treatment of HIV), but also for cosmetic fat removal without the attendant risk inherent in surgery (e.g., liposuction). See, Rotunda et al., Dermatol. Surgery 30: 1001-1008 (2004) ('Detergent effects of sodium deoxycholate are a major feature of an injectable phosphatidylcholine formulation used for localized fat dissolution') and Rotunda et al., J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. (2005: 973-978) ('Lipomas treated with subcutaneous deoxycholate injections'), both incorporated herein by reference.

""Pharmaceutical grade bile acid preparations are commercially available at relatively low cost. This low cost is due to the fact that the bile acids are obtained from animal carcasses, particularly large animals such as cows and sheep. Importantly, as with all medicaments from animal sources, there is concern that the animal-derived bile acid products may contain animal pathogens and other harmful agents such as animal or microbial metabolites and toxins, including bacterial toxins such as pyrogens.

""Currently, the concerns regarding animal-derived products containing animal pathogens and other harmful agents has been addressed by sourcing from isolated and inspected animals. For example, deoxycholic acid from animals in New Zealand are a source of bile acids for human use under US regulatory regimes, as long as the animals continue to remain isolated and otherwise free of observable pathogens.

""There remains a need for suitable quantities of efficacious bile acids such as deoxycholic acids that are known from the outset to be free from moieties of animal origin (or pathogenic moieties capable of acting in an animal, particularly a mammal, and for human use, having a deleterious effect on a human), and other harmful agents such as animal or microbial metabolites, toxins, including bacterial toxins, such as pyrogens, for use as medicaments in humans.""

""Rapid removal of body fat is an age-old ideal, and many substances have been claimed to accomplish such results, although few have shown results. 'Mesotherapy', or the use of injectables for the removal of fat, is not widely accepted among medical practitioners due to safety and efficacy concerns, although homeopathic and cosmetic claims have been made since the 1950's. Mesotherapy was originally conceived in Europe as a method of utilizing cutaneous injections containing a mixture of compounds for the treatment of local medical and cosmetic conditions. Although mesotherapy was traditionally employed for pain relief, its cosmetic applications, particularly fat and cellulite removal, have recently received attention in the United States. One such reported treatment for localized fat reduction, which was popularized in Brazil and uses injections of phosphatidylcholine, has been erroneously considered synonymous with mesotherapy. Despite its attraction as a purported 'fat-dissolving' injection, the safety and efficacy of these cosmetic treatments remain ambiguous to most patients and physicians. See, Rotunda, A. M. and M. Kolodney, Dermatologic Surgery 32: 465-480 (2006) ('Mesotherapy and Phosphatidylcholine Injections: Historical Clarification and Review').

""Recently published literature reports that the bile acid deoxycholic acid has fat removing properties when injected into fatty deposits in vivo. See, WO 2005/117900 and WO 2005/112942, as well as US2005/0261258; US2005/0267080; US2006/127468; and US20060154906, all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety including figures). Deoxycholate injected into fat tissue has the effects of: 1) degrading fat cells via a cytolytic mechanism; and 2) causing skin tightening. Both of these effects are required to mediate the desired aesthetic corrections (i.e., body contouring). Because deoxycholate injected into fat is rapidly inactivated by exposure to protein and then rapidly returns to the intestinal contents, its effects are spatially contained. As a result of this attenuation effect that confers clinical safety, fat removal therapies typically require 4-6 sessions. This localized fat removal without the need for surgery is beneficial not only for therapeutic treatment relating to pathological localized fat deposits (e.g., dyslipidemias incident to medical intervention in the treatment of HIV), but also for cosmetic fat removal without the attendant risk inherent in surgery (e.g., liposuction). See, Rotunda et al., Dermatol. Surgery 30: 1001-1008 (2004) ('Detergent effects of sodium deoxycholate are a major feature of an injectable phosphatidylcholine formulation used for localized fat dissolution') and Rotunda et al., J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. (2005: 973-978) ('Lipomas treated with subcutaneous deoxycholate injections'), both incorporated herein by reference.

""Pharmaceutical grade bile acid preparations are commercially available at relatively low cost. This low cost is due to the fact that the bile acids are obtained from animal carcasses, particularly large animals such as cows and sheep. Importantly, as with all medicaments from animal sources, there is concern that the animal-derived bile acid products may contain animal pathogens and other harmful agents such as animal or microbial metabolites and toxins, including bacterial toxins such as pyrogens.

Signals for one of the nation's biggest local broadcasters went dark on satellite-TV distributor Dish Network Corp. on Tuesday, the result of a dispute over a new distribution contract.

Dish and Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. have been negotiating a contract that covers more than 150 local television stations owned or managed by Sinclair that reach more than five million customers in 79 markets nationwide. The signals were pulled from Dish after efforts to sign a new agreement or extend the existing one failed.

Besides owning 121 TV stations, Sinclair also manages 32 through partnerships. Of the 153 stations, 87 are affiliates of the four major broadcast networks -- CBS Corp., Comcast Corp.'s NBC, Walt Disney Co.'s ABC and Twentieth Century Fox's Fox -- meaning customers lost access to local and national news programming as well as sports carried by those stations.

Dish said 129 stations in 36 states and the District of Columbia had been pulled from its service. An additional 23 stations that Sinclair negotiates distribution agreements for remain on Dish.

In a statement, Dish said it had come to terms with Sinclair on fees to carry its TV stations but the broadcaster was holding out to try to leverage distribution for a cable channel it does not yet own. Dish declined to provide details but Sinclair has expressed interest in starting its own cable network focused on high school and college sports

""Sinclair rejected our extension offer and has chosen to use innocent consumers as pawns to gain leverage for the economic benefit of Sinclair, while causing substantial harm and disruption to the lives of consumers,"" said Warren Schlichting, Dish's senior vice president of programming.

Sinclair General Counsel Barry Faber confirmed the broadcaster's signals were out of Dish homes but declined further comment.

MEDTRONIC

Moving Overseas

Helps in New Buyout

Medtronic PLC's $458 million acquisition of California startup Twelve Inc. is the latest example of how the company is taking advantage of the tax benefits it gained after reincorporating overseas earlier this year.

Medtronic moved its headquarters from Minneapolis after acquiring Dublin-based Covidien PLC for $43 billion. That move allowed the medical-device maker to spend more of its overseas cash in the U.S. without having to pay U.S. tax on it -- a perk Chief Executive Omar Ishrak has said Medtronic would use to help it acquire U.S. technology.

The U.S. Treasury has criticized companies for trying to ""avoid U.S. taxes"" through such ""tax inversions.""

Twelve., based in Redwood City, Calif., is developing a device aimed at repairing faulty mitral valves in the hear. Twelve's investors include the venture-capital firms Domain Associates, Versant Ventures and Morgenthaler Ventures.

From the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: ""Peroxide and peroxyacid compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide, have been disclosed as useful in teeth whitening compositions, Application of UV or visible light from, e.g., Argon lasers, has been employed to accelerate whitening after application of peroxide compositions to the teeth. Additionally, whitening compositions have been described that include compounds capable of absorbing light and converting it to heat or chemical energy, such as the metal-ligand complexes and metal chelate precursors described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,343,933 to Montgomery et al.

""Red dyes have also been employed to absorb visible or UV energy and produce heat in a bleaching composition as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,709 to Banerjee et al. This patent also describes attempts to further enhance such compositions by adding metal ions, an organo-metallic enzyme (e.g., catalase), or using high pH (e.g., above 7) to destabilize or activate the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Teeth whitening compositions have also been described that include violet or blue-violet dyes to counter-stain yellow teeth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,222 to Tarver. Rhodamine B dye has been employed in a teeth whitening composition as described in WO 02/22097 to Verheyen et al.

""Tooth sensitivity following treatment, and the time required for teeth whitening compositions (typically requiring about an hour of time or multiple applications or both), however, remains a significant drawback.""

Supplementing the background information on this patent, VerticalNews reporters also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""The present invention provides novel compositions and methods that whiten teeth in a surprisingly short amount of time (e.g., about 1 to 10 minutes) and with minimal or no sensitivity post-treatment. The invention is based, in part, on the discovery that the use of the dyes described herein dramatically accelerates the whitening process.

""Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that inclusion of these dyes significantly enhances the compositions of the invention at least because it is believed that dentin transmits green light and absorbs blue light. Accordingly, the dyes of the present invention enhance whitening not only at the surface of the tooth, but also may be transmitting light into the tooth to enhance the alteration of color agents by radicals that have penetrated into the tooth surface.

""Another advantage of the present invention is that the compositions can be effective when applied only for a short period of time (e.g., 1 minute in some embodiments). Accordingly, sensitivity due to, e.g., percolation of hydrogen peroxide to the pulp tissue causing (e.g., pulpal inflammation), may be minimized or eliminated. Another advantage of the present invention is that the compositions do not require compounds that generate heat, and therefore, discomfort associated with compositions that generate heat may be minimized or eliminated. Yet another advantage is that dyes can be used (e.g., Eosin B) that are less toxic than dyes such as Rhodamine B.

""In one aspect, the present invention features a tooth whitening composition which includes an oxidizing agent and an activating agent having an emission wavelength between about 400 nm and about 570 nm.

""In one embodiment, the activating agent is capable of emitting green light, blue light or blue-green light, and/or absorbs green light, blue light or blue-green light. In another embodiment, the activating agent comprises Eosin B, Erythrosin B, or both.

""In another embodiment, the composition further includes a stabilizing agent. In one embodiment, the stabilizing agent is sodium acetate.

""In one embodiment, the composition further includes a thickening agent. In one embodiment, the thickening agent is silicon dioxide and/or fumed silica having a particle size less than one micron.

""In one embodiment, the composition further includes a hydrophilic gelling agent. In another embodiment, the composition further includes an accelerator agent. In some embodiments, the accelerator agent includes sodium perborate.

""In recent years, a strong demand for the automated analysis of liquid samples has been observed, which is primarily due to the fact that there is an ongoing increase in the number of clinical analyses. Sample analysis most typically involves mixing of the samples with one or more reagents for determining the absence/presence and optionally concentration of one or more analytes contained therein. Commercially available analyzers typically use pipetting robots for pipetting samples and reagents.

""Many reagents have to be cooled and/or conditioned (e.g. mixed) before their use. In daily practice, it is convenient to cool-store the reagent containers obtained from a supplier and to leave the reagents therein until the reagent is needed. Commercially available instruments for the automated processing of liquid samples often comprise a dedicated loading device for loading the cooled reagent containers on a handling device such as a container carousel for withdrawing portions of the pre-cooled reagents contained therein with a pipette inserted through a container opening.

""Due to the fact that reaction conditions may vary with temperatures, many reactions for analyzing liquid samples require that the sample/reagent mixtures are heated or incubated prior to transferring the reacted sample to an analyzer. Usually, the temperature of the sample/reagent mixtures is raised and kept constant for at least one specific time interval to enable the desired reactions to run and to provide a generally controlled environment under which the reactions may be carried out. As a result, comparable analytical results may be reliably obtained.

Patent Issued for Instrument and Process for the Automated Processing of Liquid Samples (USPTO 9134332)","Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc. Patent Issued for Instrument and Process for the Automated Processing of Liquid Samples (USPTO 9134332)Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The present disclosure generally relates to clinical analysis and medical diagnostics and, in particular, to an instrument and process for the automated processing of liquid samples.

""In recent years, a strong demand for the automated analysis of liquid samples has been observed, which is primarily due to the fact that there is an ongoing increase in the number of clinical analyses. Sample analysis most typically involves mixing of the samples with one or more reagents for determining the absence/presence and optionally concentration of one or more analytes contained therein. Commercially available analyzers typically use pipetting robots for pipetting samples and reagents.

""Many reagents have to be cooled and/or conditioned (e.g. mixed) before their use. In daily practice, it is convenient to cool-store the reagent containers obtained from a supplier and to leave the reagents therein until the reagent is needed. Commercially available instruments for the automated processing of liquid samples often comprise a dedicated loading device for loading the cooled reagent containers on a handling device such as a container carousel for withdrawing portions of the pre-cooled reagents contained therein with a pipette inserted through a container opening.

""Due to the fact that reaction conditions may vary with temperatures, many reactions for analyzing liquid samples require that the sample/reagent mixtures are heated or incubated prior to transferring the reacted sample to an analyzer. Usually, the temperature of the sample/reagent mixtures is raised and kept constant for at least one specific time interval to enable the desired reactions to run and to provide a generally controlled environment under which the reactions may be carried out. As a result, comparable analytical results may be reliably obtained.

""There is a need for an improved automated instrument for analyzing samples involving the use of cooled reagents to prepare sample/reagent mixtures and involving incubation of the sample/reagent mixtures in order to obtain the reacted sample that has a reduced footprint and has an improved workflow for processing the liquid samples.""

Even with the price negotiated by VA with the company's maker, Gilead Sciences Inc . of Foster City, California — $594 per dose — treatment would run nearly $12 billion.

Consequently, VA takes a conservative approach, reserving Sovaldi and its competitor, Olysio, made by Janssen Therapeutics of Titusville, New Jersey (negotiated price: $413 per pill), for those with advanced liver disease or in need of a transplant.

In fiscal 2014, the Veterans Health Administration treated more than 5,400 veterans with Sovaldi at a cost of $370 million. And VA has asked Congress for roughly $1.3 billion to provide Sovaldi and other new hepatitis C drugs for another 30,000 patients.

But even with the more than 40 percent discount VA has negotiated with Gilead, the department pays more for the total treatment regimen, an average of $68,500, than the health systems of Canada, where 12 weeks of Sovaldi costs $55,000; Germany, where it costs $66,000; or India, where Gilead is negotiating to provide generic versions for $2,000.

The price differential has led some U.S. lawmakers and advocates to accuse the company of price gouging.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in December during a congressional hearing that Gilead bought the company that developed Sovaldi for $11 billion and is expected to make more than $200 billion from the drug. In the first three quarters of 2014, Gilead made $11.4 billion in sales of the medication, according to quarterly earnings reports.

""When a company can make back an $11 billion investment in just one year on just one drug, is that too much? ... We're looking at a company who is milking a cash cow for everything it's worth,"" Sanders said.

Gilead executives were asked to speak at the hearing but declined, citing overseas business travel, Sanders said.

But in an email to Military Times, Gilead spokeswoman Michele Rest defended the price and the company's billing structure. Noting that Sovaldi does not merely provide a ""long-term or indefinite treatment,"" but rather cures a life-threatening disease and wards off the need for the kind of costly lifelong care required after liver transplants, Rest said the price ""reflects the value of the medicine.""

Sovaldi also is priced similarly to other hepatitis C regimens that take up to a year and have significant side effects, she added.

Rest said Gilead offers a tiered pricing program in different locations, with countries categorized by gross national income per capita and the prevalence of hepatitis C infections in their populations.

About 3.2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The virus is spread by shared needles, an inadvertent needle stick, or having sex or using the toiletries (toothbrush, razor) of an infected person.

Also at risk are those who received a blood transplant or organ transplant before 1992, when widespread screening became available in the U.S.

VA is the largest single provider of hepatitis C care in the U.S., with a high-risk population of Vietnam War veterans who may have contracted the disease through blood transfusions for battlefield injuries or the intravenous drug use common in the era.

VA has screened aggressively for the disease, testing nearly two-thirds of all patients born from 1945 to 1965. But being on the forefront of hepatitis detection and treatment means the department also has a significant share of patients with the virus.

And as those patients age, their livers are failing.

""The introduction of very costly, highly effective and less toxic anti-viral therapies, which are easier to administer than older treatments, holds the promise of eradicating this disease in infected veterans,"" said Michael Valentino, chief consultant for pharmacy benefits at VA. ""However, addressing the cost of these agents remains a major challenge.""

The Defense Department requires Tricare beneficiaries to receive prior authorization to get these medications but has made them available, through military treatment facilities, by mail order and at retail pharmacies.

Tricare spokesman Kevin Dwyer said the DoD's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will review the medications in May to consider their use, therapy outcomes, new products and all clinical evidence to provide recommendations on which medications should be placed in the DoD uniform formulary and guidelines for their use.

According to Valentino, new hepatitis C treatments from other manufacturers are expected later this year, and he expressed hope that the new regimens would relieve the budget crunch caused by the cost of Sovaldi and other current medications.

But Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen , warned that the prices of the new options might not be any better, and he pressed Congress for policy changes such as nonvoluntary licensing of new hepatitis C drugs with the intent to lower costs, or a government buyout of the patent.","['gilsci', 'gilsci', 'gilsci', 'pblczn', 'tiboti', 'uscdcp', 'usvtha', 'pblczn', 'usvet']","['usvet', 'pblczn', 'gilsci']","Gannett Co., Inc. - Newspaper Division",",usa,namz,",NAMZ USA ,"One of the costliest drugs on the market threatens the Veterans Affairs Department's health budget — to the point that VA, which added the medication to its formulary in April, provides it to only the sickest patients who need it.

569,,POLGOV0020150313eb3j002tr,1,1.0,1.0,KeastJessica,KeastJessica,KeastJessica,No_by_Default,,,,,,Yes,"News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to implantable cardiac devices, and more particularly to implantable medical devices that communicate with an external device through radio frequency (RF) signals.

""Numerous medical devices exist today, including but not limited to electrocardiographs ('ECGs'), electroencephalographs ('EEGs'), squid magnetometers, implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ('ICDs'), neurostimulators, electrophysiology ('EP') mapping and radio frequency ('RF') ablation systems, and the like. Implantable medical devices (hereafter generally 'implantable medical devices' or 'IMDs') are configured to be implanted within patient anatomy and commonly employ one or more leads with electrodes that either receive or deliver voltage, current or other electromagnetic pulses (generally 'energy') from or to an organ or tissue (collectively hereafter 'tissue') for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.

""Various IMDs are monitored by a programmer, such as remote care or base station, which is remotely located from the IMDs. For example, a patient may have an IMD that communicates with a base station within the patient's home. The base station may be located by a patient's bedside. The base station receives data from the IMD regarding the patient's physiological state and/or the operation state of the IMD. Based on the received data, the base station may convey the data to a remote server of a medical care network, or adjust operating parameters for the IMD. For example, the base station may adjust operating parameters of the IMD, such as when a patient experiences changes in arrhythmia, pacing, ST shift, various types of ischemia, base rate, and the like.

""Many IMDs include an RF capability to communicate with the programmer. Data may be received from the base station when transmitted over varies frequency bands, such as at a 402-405 MHz frequency range, which represents the Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) band. The MICS band enables a short-range, wireless link to be maintained between low-power implanted IMDs and an external programmer or base station.

""An RF chip within a typical IMD periodically scans select frequency bands, such as the 2.45 GHz band, over the life of the IMD. The 2.45 GHz band is an unlicensed, microwave band. The IMD uses information received over the 2.45 GHz band to determine if the programmer is seeking to communicate with the IMD over another band (for example, the MICS band), which is used to receive and transmit data to and from the IMD. If the RF chip operating at a 2.45 GHz band detects that the programmer desires to communicate over the MICS band, the IMD then switches over to the MICS band. Bidirectional communication over the MICS band consumes substantially more power than the 2.45 GHz band. As such, through the use of the 2.45 GHz band, which is used to detect whether the programmer is attempting to communicate with the IMD, the IMD conserves energy. In general, the MICS band (for example, the 402-405 MHz band) affords a longer range and more robust connection than the 2.45 GHz band. However, as compared to the MICS band, the 2.45 GHz band draws less power from the IMD when scanning for connection requests and during a communications session.

""In order to establish an RF communication link between a programmer and an IMD in some known systems, the programmer first establishes a short range inductive link with the IMD after an inductive wand is placed in proximity to the IMD. The programmer then sends an inductive telemetry command through the established inductive link to the IMD in order to initiate an MICS band RF scan for all allocated MICS band channels. The programmer then instructs the wand to establish an MICS band link with the IMD. Typically, the programmer assesses the channels and selects the clearest or least-interfered MICS channel from the available allocated MICS channels. The connection request is sent through the selected channels. When the RF chip in the IMD detects the connection request, the RF chip completes the MICS band link through coordinated actions between the RF chip and device firmware.

""The communication connection process described above works well so long as the IMD, the wand, and the external programmer include inductive hardware. By default, the IMD typically does not perform a frequent scan on the MICS channel seeking a connection request, as doing so would deplete too much energy. Instead, the IMD scans the MICS channel after receiving a specific command from the programmer received over inductive hardware. As such, the IMD saves energy, which ensures longevity. At the same time, the programmer connects to a specifically-targeted IMD, because the inductive connection is typically targeted with a specific IMD at a short range.

""However, with RF-only devices that do not include inductive hardware, the programmer may initiate a wake-up with multiple devices over the 2.45 GHz band. For example, if multiple IMDs are in close proximity with one another, each of the IMDs may be scanning the 2.45 GHz band and respond to a connection request from the programmer. Yet, the programmer may be targeting only a single IMD, but not multiple IMDs. As such, the programmer may erroneously wake up and communicate with non-targeted IMDs.""

As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent application: ""Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide an external device configured to selectively communicate with a target implantable medical device (IMD) within a vicinity of other IMDs. The external device may include a communication module configured to communicate with the target IMD with at least a transmission request, a response analysis module configured to receive and analyze a target response signal from the target IMD and the other response signals from the other IMDs, and a power adjustment module configured to receive one or more power-adjustment request signals from the response analysis module. The power adjustment module is configured to adaptively adjust a power of a transmission request over a first frequency band based on the one or more power-adjustment request signals until the response analysis module receives only the target response signal from the target IMD. The external device is configured to communicate with the target IMD over a second frequency band after the response analysis module receives only the target response signal.

""The external device is configured to be positioned closer to the target IMD than the other IMDs. One or more of the communication module, the response analysis module, and the power adjustment module are contained within a wand that is configured to wake up the target IMD. Optionally, one or more of the communication module, the response analysis module, and the power adjustment module are contained within one or more of a patient home care system, a tablet, a smart phone, or a laptop computer.

""The communication module may be an RF communication module that is devoid of telemetry hardware that is configured to facilitate inductive communication. The power adjustment module may be configured to incrementally decrease the power of the transmission request over the first frequency band when the response analysis module receives one or more of the other signals from one of more the other IMDs. Further, the power adjustment module may be configured to incrementally increase the power of the transmission request over the first frequency band when the response analysis module does not receive the target response signal. The first frequency band may be a low power, high frequency band, such as the unlicensed 2.45 GHz band. The second frequency band may be a high power, lower frequency band in the range of 402-405 MHz.

""Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a system that may include a target implantable medical device (IMD), and an external device configured to selectively communicate with the target IMD.

""Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method of selectively communicating with a target implantable medical device (IMD) within a vicinity of other IMDs. The method may include communicating with the target IMD with a communication module, receiving a target response signal from the target IMD with a response analysis module, receiving one or more other response signals from one or more of the other IMDs with the response analysis module receive, and analyzing the target response signal and the one or more other response signals with the response analysis module. The method may also include receiving one or more power-adjustment request signals from the response analysis module at a power adjustment module, and adaptively adjusting a power of a transmission request over a first frequency band based on the one or more power-adjustment request signals until the response analysis module receives only the target response signal from the target IMD.

""The best way to protect yourself against the flu is an annual flu shot.""

The department said the influenza vaccine is recommended for virtually everyone six months of age and older. The vaccine is especially important for pregnant women, young children, seniors and anyone with underlying health conditions such as asthma, diabetes or a weakened immune system.

Because flu viruses constantly change, the department added that an annual dose of vaccine is highly recommended.

""Flu vaccine can significantly reduce the risk of disease complications like pneumonia,"" Cicero said. ""Several vaccine options are available. Flu activity usually increases soon after the holiday season, so receiving vaccine protection now will boost your immunity during the weeks and months to come.""

People with the flu can spread it to others through coughing, sneezing and talking. Flu may also be spread when people touch surfaces contaminated by virus droplets.

Flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. To minimize the risk of flu transmission, the department recommends washing hands frequently and avoiding close contact with sick people.

Additionally, individuals should avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth, which can spread viruses and bacteria. Covering mouths when coughing or sneezing also reduces the risk of transmitting flu.

574,,THWEEK0020150707eb770005l,1,1.0,1.0,Bayoan,Bayoan,Bayoan,No_by_Default,,,,,,Yes,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark - July 7, 2015 - Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA, OTC: BVNRY) today announced that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, has ordered a bulk supply of IMVAMUNE® non-replicating smallpox vaccine, valued at USD 133 million.

Under this new order, which is an extension of an existing contract, Bavarian Nordic will manufacture and store a bulk supply of IMVAMUNE. This bulk material could be converted into freeze-dried IMVAMUNE at a later date, once the freeze-drying manufacturing process has been transferred to a commercial line, and is approved by the U.S. authorities.

""This order was made possible by previous BARDA funding, which allowed us to identify a new process to extend the shelf-life of the bulk vaccine. This process now offers greater flexibility for stockpiling our vaccines by Governments. The bulk supply could represent the initial transition to a freeze-dried formulation of IMVAMUNE, once an Emergency Use Authorization has been granted,"" said Paul Chaplin, President & Chief Executive Officer of Bavarian Nordic. ""Our successful decade-long partnership with BARDA paves the way for improved public health preparedness, ensuring all Americans are protected from smallpox, including those people with compromised immune systems and skin disorders like eczema.""

The freeze-dried version of IMVAMUNE is expected to reduce the life cycle management costs based on a longer shelf life and will replace the liquid-frozen version that is currently stockpiled in the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). The freeze-dried version is well positioned to fulfill the U.S. Government's long-term requirements for sufficient non-replicating smallpox vaccine to protect 66 million Americans, comprising those for whom a replicating smallpox vaccine is not recommended and their household contacts.

Bavarian Nordic recently reported positive results from a pivotal Phase 2 study, which demonstrated that the freeze-dried and the liquid-frozen versions of the vaccine induced an equivalent immune response in people. With the clinical development now completed, the only outstanding activity to support the stockpiling of this next-generation of the vaccine by the U.S government is the finalization of the transfer of the manufacturing process, which is expected by the end of the year.

This bulk vaccine order will be produced and revenue recognized in 2016 and into 2017, and thus does not affect the Company's expectations for the financial results for 2015.

HIV normally invades cells through two receptors. The new protein blocks the points where the virus binds to both cellular receptors, leaving no point of entry. Because it attaches to both receptors rather than just one, the protein, called eCD4-IG, blocks more HIV strains than any of several powerful antibodies that have been shown to disable the virus, the researchers said. The study was published online Wednesday by the journal Nature.

“It is absolutely 100% effective,"" said Michael Farzan, a professor of infectious diseases at the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Fla., and lead author of the study. “There is no question that it is by far the broadest entry inhibitor out there.""

The approach has been tested only on four rhesus monkeys, not humans.

“This innovative research holds promise for moving us toward two important goals: achieving long-term protection from HIV infection, and putting HIV into sustained remission in chronically infected people,"" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which funded the work.

Scientists not involved with the work said it shows promise and should move into human testing quickly. An estimated 35 million people are infected with HIV, but only 13.6 million receive drug treatment that controls the amount of virus in their bodies, keeping it from multiplying and allowing them to lead relatively normal lives.

“It's very clever and very powerful,"" said Nancy Haigwood, an HIV researcher at Oregon Health and Science University, who wasn't involved in the study but wrote about its potential as a vaccine alternative in a commentary in Nature. “This is going to be much better than any vaccine on the horizon.""

The scientists created the protein by fusing together elements of both cellular receptors to which HIV binds. They then injected genetic material encoding the protein into the quadriceps of the four monkeys, stimulating production of the new molecule.

The researchers infected the monkeys with a hybrid version of HIV, administering up to four times the amount of virus it took to infect a control group. The protein protected the monkeys for 40 weeks.

Dr. Farzan said the monkeys remained infection-free even when given 16 times the amount of virus that it took to infect the control group in experiments conducted after the study was completed.

He said he hoped human trials could begin within a year, after more testing in animals that is already under way. The first step, he said, would be to gauge the ability of the molecule to keep virus levels in HIV-positive people in check.

“We believe our goal now is to show it can work therapeutically,"" he said.

The next step would be to test its efficacy as a vaccine, in people who don't have the virus but are at high risk of infection, Dr. Farzan said.

The work builds on a 2009 study that proposed using gene transfer as an alternative to a traditional vaccine for HIV.

Philip Johnson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute, who led the work this study builds on, said the new research offers promise for that concept.

“It appears to be an extraordinarily potent molecule,"" he said. “It's further validating of the idea that we should be thinking in alternate terms about how to attack HIV vaccines."" He said it should be tested in humans right away: “To me the nonhuman primate data are outstanding.""
