No. 4,151,042), as shown below:

""##STR00001##

""The naturally occurring and synthetic C-3 esters of maytansinol can be classified into two groups: (a) Maytansine (2) and its analogs (e.g., DM1 and DM4), which are C-3 esters with N-methyl-L-alanine or derivatives of N-methyl-L-alanine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,137,230; 4,260,608; 5,208,020; and Chem. Pharm. Bull. 12:3441 (1984)); (b) Ansamitocins, which are C-3 esters with simple carboxylic acids (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,248,870; 4,265,814; 4,308,268; 4,308,269; 4,309,428; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; and 4,331,598).

""Maytansine (2), its analogs and each of the ansamitocin species are C3 esters of maytansinol that can be prepared by esterification of maytansinol (1). U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,301,019 and 7,598,375 describe methods of acylating maytansinol (1), with an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid (NCA, 5), in the presence of a base to form an amino acid ester of maytansinol (May-AA, 6) as shown below:

""##STR00002##

""Amino acid esters of maytansinol are valuable intermediates that can be coupled to carboxylic acids to provide maytansinoids. For example, reaction of maytansinol with (4S)-3,4-dimethyl-2,5-oxazolidinedione (5a) forms N2'-deacetyl-maytansine (6a), which in turn can be coupled to 3-(methyldithio)propionic acid (7), using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) to form DM1-SMe (8) as shown below:

""##STR00003##

""A significant disadvantage of the acylation reaction that forms amino acid esters of maytansinol is that it also forms a by-product comprising an extra N-methyl-alanyl moiety in the C3 side chain, referred to as 'extra-NMA' (9). When N2'-deacetyl-maytansine is acylated, extra NMA (9) is also acylated to form extra NMA-DM1-SMe (9a). The structures of extra-NMA (9) and extra-NMA-DM1-SMe (9a) are shown below:

""##STR00004##

""DM1 (3) can be prepared from DM1-SMe (8) by reduction, which also converts any extra-NMA-DM1-SMe (9a) to extra-NMA-DM1 (10) as shown below:

""##STR00005##

""Extra-NMA-DM1 (10) is difficult to remove from DM1 (3) because both compounds have similar polarities and give overlapping peaks in the HPLC trace of purified DM1 (3). DM1 (3) and DM4 (4) are used to prepare antibody conjugates, several of which are currently in clinical trials.

""Thus, there is a need to improve the yield and robustness of the processes to prepare such maytansinoids and to minimize by-products formed during reactions used in their preparation.""

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""It has now been found that addition of a drying agent to the reaction between maytansinol and an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid substantially increases the yield of an amino acid ester of maytansinol, as shown in Examples 1-4. It has also been found that addition of a pre-quenching step with a nucleophile following the reaction of maytansinol and an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid substantially reduces formation of undesirable by-products, such as extra-NMA, as shown in Examples 6-8. Based on these discoveries, improved methods of preparing an amino acid ester of maytansinol are disclosed herein.

""A first embodiment of the invention is a method of preparing an amino acid ester of maytansinol represented by Formula (I):

""##STR00006## wherein R.sub.1 is hydrogen, an optionally substituted C1-C10 alkyl group or an amino acid side chain, provided that, if the amino acid side chain has a functional group, the functional group is optionally protected; and R.sub.2 is hydrogen or an optionally substituted C1-C10 alkyl group.

""The method comprises reacting maytansinol with an N-carboxyanhydride in a reaction mixture additionally comprising a base and a drying agent. The N-carboxyanhydride is represented by the following formula:

""##STR00007## All the variables in Formula (II) are as defined in Formula (I).

""A second embodiment of the invention is a method of preparing an amino acid ester of maytaninol represented by Formula (I), comprising: a) reacting maytansinol with an N-carboxyanhydride represented by Formula (II) in a reaction mixture additionally comprising a base; and b) reacting unreacted N-carboxyanhydride from step a) with a nucleophilic reagent. All the variables in Formulas (I) and (II) are as defined in the first embodiment of the invention.""

No. 4,151,042), as shown below:

""##STR00001##

""The naturally occurring and synthetic C-3 esters of maytansinol can be classified into two groups: (a) Maytansine (2) and its analogs (e.g., DM1 and DM4), which are C-3 esters with N-methyl-L-alanine or derivatives of N-methyl-L-alanine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,137,230; 4,260,608; 5,208,020; and Chem. Pharm. Bull. 12:3441 (1984)); (b) Ansamitocins, which are C-3 esters with simple carboxylic acids (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,248,870; 4,265,814; 4,308,268; 4,308,269; 4,309,428; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; and 4,331,598).

""Maytansine (2), its analogs and each of the ansamitocin species are C3 esters of maytansinol that can be prepared by esterification of maytansinol (1). U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,301,019 and 7,598,375 describe methods of acylating maytansinol (1), with an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid (NCA, 5), in the presence of a base to form an amino acid ester of maytansinol (May-AA, 6) as shown below:

""##STR00002##

""Amino acid esters of maytansinol are valuable intermediates that can be coupled to carboxylic acids to provide maytansinoids. For example, reaction of maytansinol with (4S)-3,4-dimethyl-2,5-oxazolidinedione (5a) forms N2'-deacetyl-maytansine (6a), which in turn can be coupled to 3-(methyldithio)propionic acid (7), using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) to form DM1-SMe (8) as shown below:

""##STR00003##

""A significant disadvantage of the acylation reaction that forms amino acid esters of maytansinol is that it also forms a by-product comprising an extra N-methyl-alanyl moiety in the C3 side chain, referred to as 'extra-NMA' (9). When N2'-deacetyl-maytansine is acylated, extra NMA (9) is also acylated to form extra NMA-DM1-SMe (9a). The structures of extra-NMA (9) and extra-NMA-DM1-SMe (9a) are shown below:

No. 4,151,042), as shown below:

""##STR00001##

""The naturally occurring and synthetic C-3 esters of maytansinol can be classified into two groups: (a) Maytansine (2) and its analogs (e.g., DM1 and DM4), which are C-3 esters with N-methyl-L-alanine or derivatives of N-methyl-L-alanine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,137,230; 4,260,608; 5,208,020; and Chem. Pharm. Bull. 12:3441 (1984)); (b) Ansamitocins, which are C-3 esters with simple carboxylic acids (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,248,870; 4,265,814; 4,308,268; 4,308,269; 4,309,428; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; and 4,331,598).

""Maytansine (2), its analogs and each of the ansamitocin species are C3 esters of maytansinol that can be prepared by esterification of maytansinol (1). U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,301,019 and 7,598,375 describe methods of acylating maytansinol (1), with an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid (NCA, 5), in the presence of a base to form an amino acid ester of maytansinol (May-AA, 6) as shown below:

""##STR00002##

""Amino acid esters of maytansinol are valuable intermediates that can be coupled to carboxylic acids to provide maytansinoids. For example, reaction of maytansinol with (4S)-3,4-dimethyl-2,5-oxazolidinedione (5a) forms N2'-deacetyl-maytansine (6a), which in turn can be coupled to 3-(methyldithio)propionic acid (7), using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) to form DM1-SMe (8) as shown below:

""##STR00003##

""A significant disadvantage of the acylation reaction that forms amino acid esters of maytansinol is that it also forms a by-product comprising an extra N-methyl-alanyl moiety in the C3 side chain, referred to as 'extra-NMA' (9). When N2'-deacetyl-maytansine is acylated, extra NMA (9) is also acylated to form extra NMA-DM1-SMe (9a). The structures of extra-NMA (9) and extra-NMA-DM1-SMe (9a) are shown below:

""##STR00004##

""DM1 (3) can be prepared from DM1-SMe (8) by reduction, which also converts any extra-NMA-DM1-SMe (9a) to extra-NMA-DM1 (10) as shown below:

""##STR00005##

""Extra-NMA-DM1 (10) is difficult to remove from DM1 (3) because both compounds have similar polarities and give overlapping peaks in the HPLC trace of purified DM1 (3). DM1 (3) and DM4 (4) are used to prepare antibody conjugates, several of which are currently in clinical trials.

""Thus, there is a need to improve the yield and robustness of the processes to prepare such maytansinoids and to minimize by-products formed during reactions used in their preparation.""

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""It has now been found that addition of a drying agent to the reaction between maytansinol and an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid substantially increases the yield of an amino acid ester of maytansinol, as shown in Examples 1-4. It has also been found that addition of a pre-quenching step with a nucleophile following the reaction of maytansinol and an N-carboxyanhydride of an amino acid substantially reduces formation of undesirable by-products, such as extra-NMA, as shown in Examples 6-8. Based on these discoveries, improved methods of preparing an amino acid ester of maytansinol are disclosed herein.

""A first embodiment of the invention is a method of preparing an amino acid ester of maytansinol represented by Formula (I):

""##STR00006## wherein R.sub.1 is hydrogen, an optionally substituted C1-C10 alkyl group or an amino acid side chain, provided that, if the amino acid side chain has a functional group, the functional group is optionally protected; and R.sub.2 is hydrogen or an optionally substituted C1-C10 alkyl group.

""The method comprises reacting maytansinol with an N-carboxyanhydride in a reaction mixture additionally comprising a base and a drying agent. The N-carboxyanhydride is represented by the following formula:

""##STR00007## All the variables in Formula (II) are as defined in Formula (I).

Quantification measures included comet number (comet count) and the fraction of the ultrasound beams with comet findings (comet fraction). We used this algorithm in a pilot study in 20 stable dialysis outpatients to identify associations between ultrasound comets and clinical parameters including blood pressure (BP), percent blood volume reduction on dialysis (%BV), ejection fraction (EF), and ultrafiltration on dialysis (UF). Positive findings included associations with lung comet measurements with pre-dialysis Diastolic BP (r = 0.534, p = 0.015), subject age (r = -0.446, p = 0.049), and a combination of EF and end dialysis %BV reduction (r = -0.585, p = 0.028). Comet fraction and comet count were closely correlated due to the inherent relationship between these two metrics (r = 0.973, p< 0.001). Negative findings included ultrasound comets that did not change from beginning to end of dialysis (p = 0.756), and were not significantly correlated with single dialysis treatment UF (p = 0.522), subject body weight (p = 0.208), or BMI (p = 0.358). Ultrasound signal processing methods may help quantify lung ultrasound comets.""

According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Additional findings include algorithmic lung comet measurement that did not change significantly during single dialysis sessions in these stable outpatients, but were associated with cardiovascular and fluid status parameters.""

Positive findings included associations with lung comet measurements with pre-dialysis Diastolic BP (r = 0.534, p = 0.015), subject age (r = -0.446, p = 0.049), and a combination of EF and end dialysis %BV reduction (r = -0.585, p = 0.028). Comet fraction and comet count were closely correlated due to the inherent relationship between these two metrics (r = 0.973, p< 0.001).

7/24/19 12:02,DEALNEW020150316eb390000a,Throw,-1,4,4,,FowersAlyssa_KattampallilNeil_Extra2_SavchynKateryna,,,No,,,,,,No,"RegenMedTX has agreed to pay $1.5 million in cash for the debtor's assets. Under the deal, secured creditors Deerfield Special Situations Fund LP, RA Capital Healthcare Funds LP and Celgene Corp. (CELG) will assign $20.56 million in claims to the buyer in exchange for 25% of the aggregate membership interests in the buyer, a clinical-stage company developing regenerative products.

The buyer will acquire all the debtor's intellectual property and biological samples related to its trials housed at its Winston-Salem, N.C., headquarters. (Three employees have been regularly monitoring the headquarters, including responding to any alarms at the property.)

No other offers for the assets were submitted by the Friday sale hearing, according to Jeffrey Testa of McCarter & English LLP, counsel to Chapter 7 trustee Charles A. Stanziale Jr.

""We think it's a great result whenever a trustee can both save a business and be in a position to make a distribution to unsecured creditors, so we believe it's a win-win,"" Testa said. He added that 5% of the net sale proceeds will be set aside to fund a recovery to unsecured creditors.

Stanziale said the buyer intended to put up the money to continue the approval process for Tengion's regenerative medicine.

He said that process could cost ""in the tens of millions of dollars"" and estimated it could take up to three years. Keeping the patents alone costs $100,000 per month, Stanziale said.

Stanziale, who acknowledged the sale would not ""in my view come close to paying creditors,"" added: ""Is it a plus to have the research and [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval [process] go forward in what may be a breakthrough health remedy? That's a different story, and that's a good thing.""<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

He continued, ""So all of the time and the effort and the money that has been spent for research and approval will not go out the window.""

Stanziale said the buyer originally did not offer to include a credit bid component and only offered $600,000 cash, but he and his team ""talked them up significantly.""

The deal was scheduled to close Monday.

""It had to be done quickly because the research that was in cold storage needed to be attended to, and we couldn't take the risk of losing the currency on the patents and losing the frozen research [by waiting],"" he said. ""We couldn't put that in jeopardy.""

Stanziale said he was satisfied there wouldn't be a higher offer for the assets because they had been ""well shopped"" before and during bankruptcy.

Court papers show the company has made the necessary payments to maintain the clinical programs and research through December.

In a Feb. 12 motion, Stanziale said that in his business judgment the offer from RegenMedTX, which would relieve the estate of the secured claims, was superior to any bid from a third-party buyer.<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

""As a result, the Chapter 7 trustee believes that the buyer's offer for the assets is the highest or otherwise best offer that can be obtained under the circumstances,"" he said in the document.

Tengion's first clinical program was its Neo-Kidney Augment, intended to prevent or delay dialysis and transplantation by boosting renal function in patients that have advanced chronic kidney disease, according to its website. The debtor had received regulatory approval to begin clinical trials on the product.

Additionally, the company's second clinical program, Neo-Urinary Conduit, was in clinical trials. The product is an implant made from a patient's own cells and is ""intended to catalyze regeneration of native-like urinary tissue, thereby eliminating the need to use bowel tissue in the current standard of care surgery,"" the company said on its website.

Faced with a funding shortage, Tengion submitted a Chapter 7 petition on Dec. 29, just after the company warned of a potential filing.

The company's board of directors on Dec. 1 voted to terminate all 29 employees, who served in research, development, financial and administrative roles, according to a Dec. 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The debtor said it would pay out $916,000 in severance payments in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Tengion opted to let go of the employees to preserve cash, as it faced high operating expenditures and debt repayments.

""Despite these cost-cutting measures, if financing is not obtained, the company will not be able to remain in business and will likely need to seek protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws,"" the company warned in the filing.<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

Tengion announced on Sept. 22 that it had retained Jefferies LLC as financial adviser to assist it with ""reviewing and structuring potential strategic transactions.""

On March 26, auditor Ernst & Young LLP had issued a going concern warning for the company due to its recurring losses from operations and cash flow deficit.

In a Nov. 14 statement, Tengion said that it had experienced an adjusted net loss of $6.6 million for the three months ended Sept. 30.

The company blamed the loss on a rise in research and development expenses and administrative costs. The company also said legal costs related to the preparation of a market assessment of its kidney program also constrained cash flow.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Tengion reported a $19.3 million adjusted net loss on no revenue.

In its latest quarterly report, the company listed $9.62 million in assets and $93 million in liabilities as of Sept. 30. (In its petition, Tengion reported $1 million to $10 million in assets and $10 million to $50 million in liabilities.)

Tengion on July 1, 2013, raised $33.6 million in a private placement to fund Phase 1 clinical trials of its kidney program.

The company's shares, which trade on the OTC Pink tier of OTC Markets, closed down 25% at 0.15 cents Monday.

In a Feb. 12 motion, Stanziale said that in his business judgment the offer from RegenMedTX, which would relieve the estate of the secured claims, was superior to any bid from a third-party buyer.<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

""As a result, the Chapter 7 trustee believes that the buyer's offer for the assets is the highest or otherwise best offer that can be obtained under the circumstances,"" he said in the document.

Tengion's first clinical program was its Neo-Kidney Augment, intended to prevent or delay dialysis and transplantation by boosting renal function in patients that have advanced chronic kidney disease, according to its website. The debtor had received regulatory approval to begin clinical trials on the product.

Additionally, the company's second clinical program, Neo-Urinary Conduit, was in clinical trials. The product is an implant made from a patient's own cells and is ""intended to catalyze regeneration of native-like urinary tissue, thereby eliminating the need to use bowel tissue in the current standard of care surgery,"" the company said on its website.

Faced with a funding shortage, Tengion submitted a Chapter 7 petition on Dec. 29, just after the company warned of a potential filing.

The company's board of directors on Dec. 1 voted to terminate all 29 employees, who served in research, development, financial and administrative roles, according to a Dec. 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The debtor said it would pay out $916,000 in severance payments in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Tengion opted to let go of the employees to preserve cash, as it faced high operating expenditures and debt repayments.

""Despite these cost-cutting measures, if financing is not obtained, the company will not be able to remain in business and will likely need to seek protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws,"" the company warned in the filing.<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

Tengion announced on Sept. 22 that it had retained Jefferies LLC as financial adviser to assist it with ""reviewing and structuring potential strategic transactions.""

On March 26, auditor Ernst & Young LLP had issued a going concern warning for the company due to its recurring losses from operations and cash flow deficit.

In a Nov. 14 statement, Tengion said that it had experienced an adjusted net loss of $6.6 million for the three months ended Sept. 30.

The company blamed the loss on a rise in research and development expenses and administrative costs. The company also said legal costs related to the preparation of a market assessment of its kidney program also constrained cash flow.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Tengion reported a $19.3 million adjusted net loss on no revenue.

In its latest quarterly report, the company listed $9.62 million in assets and $93 million in liabilities as of Sept. 30. (In its petition, Tengion reported $1 million to $10 million in assets and $10 million to $50 million in liabilities.)

Tengion on July 1, 2013, raised $33.6 million in a private placement to fund Phase 1 clinical trials of its kidney program.

The company's shares, which trade on the OTC Pink tier of OTC Markets, closed down 25% at 0.15 cents Monday.

The debtor had received regulatory approval to begin clinical trials on the product.

Additionally, the company's second clinical program, Neo-Urinary Conduit, was in clinical trials. The product is an implant made from a patient's own cells and is ""intended to catalyze regeneration of native-like urinary tissue, thereby eliminating the need to use bowel tissue in the current standard of care surgery,"" the company said on its website.

Faced with a funding shortage, Tengion submitted a Chapter 7 petition on Dec. 29, just after the company warned of a potential filing.

The company's board of directors on Dec. 1 voted to terminate all 29 employees, who served in research, development, financial and administrative roles, according to a Dec. 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The debtor said it would pay out $916,000 in severance payments in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Tengion opted to let go of the employees to preserve cash, as it faced high operating expenditures and debt repayments.

""Despite these cost-cutting measures, if financing is not obtained, the company will not be able to remain in business and will likely need to seek protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws,"" the company warned in the filing.<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

Tengion announced on Sept. 22 that it had retained Jefferies LLC as financial adviser to assist it with ""reviewing and structuring potential strategic transactions.""

On March 26, auditor Ernst & Young LLP had issued a going concern warning for the company due to its recurring losses from operations and cash flow deficit.

In a Nov. 14 statement, Tengion said that it had experienced an adjusted net loss of $6.6 million for the three months ended Sept. 30.

The company blamed the loss on a rise in research and development expenses and administrative costs. The company also said legal costs related to the preparation of a market assessment of its kidney program also constrained cash flow.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Tengion reported a $19.3 million adjusted net loss on no revenue.

In its latest quarterly report, the company listed $9.62 million in assets and $93 million in liabilities as of Sept. 30. (In its petition, Tengion reported $1 million to $10 million in assets and $10 million to $50 million in liabilities.)

Tengion on July 1, 2013, raised $33.6 million in a private placement to fund Phase 1 clinical trials of its kidney program.

The company's shares, which trade on the OTC Pink tier of OTC Markets, closed down 25% at 0.15 cents Monday.

7/24/19 11:38,DEALNEW020150316eb390000a,Keep,-1,4,4,,Gizem review,,,No,,,,,,No,"RegenMedTX has agreed to pay $1.5 million in cash for the debtor's assets. Under the deal, secured creditors Deerfield Special Situations Fund LP, RA Capital Healthcare Funds LP and Celgene Corp. (CELG) will assign $20.56 million in claims to the buyer in exchange for 25% of the aggregate membership interests in the buyer, a clinical-stage company developing regenerative products.

The buyer will acquire all the debtor's intellectual property and biological samples related to its trials housed at its Winston-Salem, N.C., headquarters. (Three employees have been regularly monitoring the headquarters, including responding to any alarms at the property.)

No other offers for the assets were submitted by the Friday sale hearing, according to Jeffrey Testa of McCarter & English LLP, counsel to Chapter 7 trustee Charles A. Stanziale Jr.

""We think it's a great result whenever a trustee can both save a business and be in a position to make a distribution to unsecured creditors, so we believe it's a win-win,"" Testa said. He added that 5% of the net sale proceeds will be set aside to fund a recovery to unsecured creditors.

Stanziale said the buyer intended to put up the money to continue the approval process for Tengion's regenerative medicine.

He said that process could cost ""in the tens of millions of dollars"" and estimated it could take up to three years. Keeping the patents alone costs $100,000 per month, Stanziale said.

Stanziale, who acknowledged the sale would not ""in my view come close to paying creditors,"" added: ""Is it a plus to have the research and [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval [process] go forward in what may be a breakthrough health remedy? That's a different story, and that's a good thing.""<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

He continued, ""So all of the time and the effort and the money that has been spent for research and approval will not go out the window.""

Stanziale said the buyer originally did not offer to include a credit bid component and only offered $600,000 cash, but he and his team ""talked them up significantly.""

The deal was scheduled to close Monday.

""It had to be done quickly because the research that was in cold storage needed to be attended to, and we couldn't take the risk of losing the currency on the patents and losing the frozen research [by waiting],"" he said. ""We couldn't put that in jeopardy.""

Stanziale said he was satisfied there wouldn't be a higher offer for the assets because they had been ""well shopped"" before and during bankruptcy.

Court papers show the company has made the necessary payments to maintain the clinical programs and research through December.

In a Feb. 12 motion, Stanziale said that in his business judgment the offer from RegenMedTX, which would relieve the estate of the secured claims, was superior to any bid from a third-party buyer.<STORY_PAGE_BREAK/>

Despite satisfactory in vitro results and in silico predictions, only one compound resulted in a statistically significant worm burden reduction (66%) after administration of a single oral dose of 400 mg/kg of body weight to S. mansoni-infected mice. Worm burden reductions of 0 to 43% were observed for the remaining eight compounds tested.""

According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""Several analogs of the N,N '-diarylurea MMV665852 had high efficacy against S. mansoni in vitro and favorable physicochemical properties for permeation through the intestinal wall. To counteract the low efficacy observed in the mouse model, further investigations should focus on identifying compounds with improved solubility and pharmacokinetic properties.""

""We are very excited to make ThermoDox(R) available to patients with breast cancer who have few options once the tumors have progressed to the chest wall. Patients with highly resistant tumors found on the chest wall often see their cancer progress despite treatment which typically involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy and hormone therapy,"" stated Dr. Nicolas Borys, Celsion's Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer. ""ThermoDox(R) coupled with mild hyperthermia therapy appears to be active in these heavily pre-treated patients with RCW breast cancer. I look forward to working with prescribing physicians and myTomorrows to bring this promising and innovative medicine to the European medical community.""

""Celsion is honored and proud to be part of this important Early Access Program that affects the lives of thousands of women each year. This Early Access Program emphasizes our commitment to addressing refractory RCW breast cancer and to providing patients and their physicians with early access to our promising therapeutic approach,"" said Michael H. Tardugno, Celsion's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""In addition to the Early Access Program, we are expanding our development efforts in this indication and plan to initiate a European-based Phase II clinical trial in RCW breast cancer patients. Our common goal is to develop and provide the most effective therapies to improve and prolong the quality of life.""

7/24/19 11:35,OKLD000020151215ebc9000b6,Throw,-1,2,2,,HalewiczVictoria_NevilleQuinton,,,Yes,Available to consumers (has been launched on the market),whole-body cryotherapy,The Performist,No,Yes,No,"Once or twice a week, she goes to the Peninsula Wellness Centre in Mountain View to stand neck-high in a closetlike tank while a fog of liquid nitrogen gas billows around her underwear-clad body. The fog takes the temperature in the tank down to 230 to 250 degrees below zero Fahrenheit -- colder than any natural place on Earth.

The technique is called whole-body cryotherapy, and yes, it may be coming to a spa, sports medicine clinic or wellness center near you.

Depending on whom you talk to, cryotherapy is either the latest fad, boasting a range of yet-to-be proven benefits -- while boosting the interests of a largely unregulated industry -- or, it's a cutting-edge therapy that can genuinely help people such as Toy resume active, normal lives. It has also become de rigueur for a growing number of elite athletes -- LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and, most recently, members of the Green Bay Packers. These pros, as well as celebrities such as Daniel Craig prepping for his latest James Bond outing, use it to reduce the aches and inflammation caused by tough workouts so they can recover quickly, exercise harder and boost performance.

""This is a supercharged ice bath,"" says Landan Laurusaitis, a personal trainer, former college football lineman, and co-founder of the recently opened Performist cryotherapy studio in Palo Alto. ""I've done a lot of ice baths, and they work wonders on your recovery, but it's not pleasant. This only takes three minutes. It basically gives you all the impact of an ice bath in a fraction of the time.""

Laurusaitis adds that hard-driving tech workers have begun to drop in at The Performist, looking for an endorphin rush from a quick chill in the studio's $75,000 tank. That boost, they say, allows them to keep working late into the evening.

Toy was skeptical of the treatment's purported benefits and worried that getting into the tank would be as much of a shock to her system as jumping into the Arctic Ocean.

But, she says, ""I would walk through fire if it would take away the pain.""

As it turned out, her treatment left her feeling briefly chilled, but it was tolerable, as if she stepped outside on a cold winter morning. She also noticed tingling in the areas of her body affected by pain, but the tingling quickly went away -- as did the pain.

""It was amazing,"" she says. ""I felt immediately better.""

She has since returned for about 40 treatments. The downside is that the treatments, ranging from $40 to $65, depending on the package, aren't covered by insurance. While she wishes the therapy were not so expensive, she thinks it's worth it.

The concept of cryotherapy is nothing new. Applying cold packs to injured joints or muscles to reduce blood flow, swelling and inflammation has long been standard practice among medical practitioners. And, as Laurusaitis said, soaking in ice baths after intense exercise is routine among professional and college athletes.

One of Laurusaitis' personal training clients, Mountain View-reared professional volleyball player Diane Copenhagen, 29, recently tried the cryotherapy tank for the first time and liked it much better than a 20- to 30-minute soak in an ice bath. ""This is an easy and fast way to help your body recover and recuperate,"" Copenhagen says.

The first cryotherapy tank was built in Japan for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The treatment spread to Europe in the 1980s and the United States in the past decade. While most users these days are professional and recreational athletes, the treatment also is used to treat symptoms of arthritis, autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders and depression.

Chiropractor Chris Watson, owner of the Peninsula Wellness Centre, also touts cryotherapy's potential for improving skin tone and helping weight loss; a single session reportedly burns anywhere from 500 to 800 calories.

The medical and scientific communities are far more reserved in their assessments, saying liquid nitrogen has been used medically for procedures such as wart removal. But so far, there is little research to show that cryotherapy offers physiological benefits, either for weight loss or for reducing muscle soreness and recovery time for athletic training.

""I remember how oxygen rooms were popping up a few years ago and a lot of athletes were using them, but the studies never really panned out,"" says Michael Fredericson, a professor of orthopedic surgery and expert in sports medicine at Stanford University Medical Center. ""I don't know if cryotherapy will end up the same way, with the therapy getting going commercially before there is really any science behind it. I'm not saying it's bad, but we don't really know.""

Joseph Costello, senior research associate in the department of sport and exercise science at the University of Portsmouth in England and one of the world's leading researchers on cryotherapy, suggests a placebo effect might be in play for some people. If anything, he says, cryotherapy offers benefits similar to cooling off skin and muscle with ice packs or ice baths, which don't cost as much.

And given that cryotherapy exposes people to extreme temperatures, he said it's imperative for more research to be done on its long-term safety.

Indeed, safety concerns arose after a 24-year-old Las Vegas spa employee was found dead in a cryotherapy chamber in October. Reports say she was using the nitrogen-filling machine alone after the center closed and died of asphyxia due to a lack of oxygen.

Cryotherapy is not regulated by the FDA or by most states, including California. The woman's death prompted Nevada health authorities to issue safety guidelines, which recommend that pregnant women or people with certain health conditions -- including high blood pressure or a history of strokes and seizures -- avoid it and that centers make sure employees are properly trained in using the machines.

Watson, of the Wellness Centre, and Stephen Evans, another co-founder of The Performist, say client safety is their No. 1 concern. New clients fill out health questionnaires and have their blood pressure checked, they say. And in contrast to the apparent practices in the Las Vegas case, an employee is always present when someone uses their chambers, they say. Of the about 1,000 people who have visited the Wellness Centre over the past year, Watson says, ""We haven't had one incident.""

To prevent potential frostbite, both centers require people to don thermal socks and gloves to protect feet and hands. They also make sure people don't go in with moist skin. Back in 2011, American sprinter Justin Gatlin said he suffered frostbite while entering a chamber wearing socks sweaty from a previous workout, according to the New York Times.

Concerns about frostbite and inconclusive information on the treatment's athletic benefits made Michael Mendenhall, 53, of Palo Alto, wary at first. But he gave it a try because he wants to compete as a master swimmer and needs to keep up a rigorous training schedule. After a week of daily sessions, he has yet to experience frostbite. Moreover, he's noticed a marked decrease in recovery time from the workouts, from one or two days to several hours. ""I just feel really good, more alert,"" he says.

While Evans agrees that more research needs to be done, he says there's enough evidence to show ""this isn't a quack thing.""

He himself hits the chamber daily to improve his training for marathons and CrossFit competitions.

The fog takes the temperature in the tank down to 230 to 250 degrees below zero Fahrenheit -- colder than any natural place on Earth.

The technique is called whole-body cryotherapy, and yes, it may be coming to a spa, sports medicine clinic or wellness center near you.

Depending on whom you talk to, cryotherapy is either the latest fad, boasting a range of yet-to-be proven benefits -- while boosting the interests of a largely unregulated industry -- or, it's a cutting-edge therapy that can genuinely help people such as Toy resume active, normal lives. It has also become de rigueur for a growing number of elite athletes -- LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and, most recently, members of the Green Bay Packers. These pros, as well as celebrities such as Daniel Craig prepping for his latest James Bond outing, use it to reduce the aches and inflammation caused by tough workouts so they can recover quickly, exercise harder and boost performance.

""This is a supercharged ice bath,"" says Landan Laurusaitis, a personal trainer, former college football lineman, and co-founder of the recently opened Performist cryotherapy studio in Palo Alto. ""I've done a lot of ice baths, and they work wonders on your recovery, but it's not pleasant. This only takes three minutes. It basically gives you all the impact of an ice bath in a fraction of the time.""

Laurusaitis adds that hard-driving tech workers have begun to drop in at The Performist, looking for an endorphin rush from a quick chill in the studio's $75,000 tank. That boost, they say, allows them to keep working late into the evening.

Toy was skeptical of the treatment's purported benefits and worried that getting into the tank would be as much of a shock to her system as jumping into the Arctic Ocean.

But, she says, ""I would walk through fire if it would take away the pain.""

As it turned out, her treatment left her feeling briefly chilled, but it was tolerable, as if she stepped outside on a cold winter morning. She also noticed tingling in the areas of her body affected by pain, but the tingling quickly went away -- as did the pain.

""It was amazing,"" she says. ""I felt immediately better.""

She has since returned for about 40 treatments. The downside is that the treatments, ranging from $40 to $65, depending on the package, aren't covered by insurance. While she wishes the therapy were not so expensive, she thinks it's worth it.

The concept of cryotherapy is nothing new. Applying cold packs to injured joints or muscles to reduce blood flow, swelling and inflammation has long been standard practice among medical practitioners. And, as Laurusaitis said, soaking in ice baths after intense exercise is routine among professional and college athletes.

One of Laurusaitis' personal training clients, Mountain View-reared professional volleyball player Diane Copenhagen, 29, recently tried the cryotherapy tank for the first time and liked it much better than a 20- to 30-minute soak in an ice bath. ""This is an easy and fast way to help your body recover and recuperate,"" Copenhagen says.

The first cryotherapy tank was built in Japan for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The treatment spread to Europe in the 1980s and the United States in the past decade. While most users these days are professional and recreational athletes, the treatment also is used to treat symptoms of arthritis, autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders and depression.

Chiropractor Chris Watson, owner of the Peninsula Wellness Centre, also touts cryotherapy's potential for improving skin tone and helping weight loss; a single session reportedly burns anywhere from 500 to 800 calories.

The medical and scientific communities are far more reserved in their assessments, saying liquid nitrogen has been used medically for procedures such as wart removal. But so far, there is little research to show that cryotherapy offers physiological benefits, either for weight loss or for reducing muscle soreness and recovery time for athletic training.

""I remember how oxygen rooms were popping up a few years ago and a lot of athletes were using them, but the studies never really panned out,"" says Michael Fredericson, a professor of orthopedic surgery and expert in sports medicine at Stanford University Medical Center. ""I don't know if cryotherapy will end up the same way, with the therapy getting going commercially before there is really any science behind it. I'm not saying it's bad, but we don't really know.""

Now the Sunnyvale woman can go for days pain-free after trying something that initially sounded extreme: subjecting her body to flash freezing for two to three minutes at a time.",OKLD,The Oakland Tribune,FALSE,"['gartt', 'gfitn', 'gnutr', 'gwelss', 'gcat', 'gfod', 'ghea', 'glife', 'gmed']","Cryotherapy: do new nitrogen tanks actually boost workouts, help weight loss?","Cryotherapy: do new nitrogen tanks actually boost workouts, help weight loss?Once or twice a week, she goes to the Peninsula Wellness Centre in Mountain View to stand neck-high in a closetlike tank while a fog of liquid nitrogen gas billows around her underwear-clad body. The fog takes the temperature in the tank down to 230 to 250 degrees below zero Fahrenheit -- colder than any natural place on Earth.

The technique is called whole-body cryotherapy, and yes, it may be coming to a spa, sports medicine clinic or wellness center near you.

Depending on whom you talk to, cryotherapy is either the latest fad, boasting a range of yet-to-be proven benefits -- while boosting the interests of a largely unregulated industry -- or, it's a cutting-edge therapy that can genuinely help people such as Toy resume active, normal lives. It has also become de rigueur for a growing number of elite athletes -- LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and, most recently, members of the Green Bay Packers. These pros, as well as celebrities such as Daniel Craig prepping for his latest James Bond outing, use it to reduce the aches and inflammation caused by tough workouts so they can recover quickly, exercise harder and boost performance.

""This is a supercharged ice bath,"" says Landan Laurusaitis, a personal trainer, former college football lineman, and co-founder of the recently opened Performist cryotherapy studio in Palo Alto. ""I've done a lot of ice baths, and they work wonders on your recovery, but it's not pleasant. This only takes three minutes. It basically gives you all the impact of an ice bath in a fraction of the time.""

Laurusaitis adds that hard-driving tech workers have begun to drop in at The Performist, looking for an endorphin rush from a quick chill in the studio's $75,000 tank. That boost, they say, allows them to keep working late into the evening.

Toy was skeptical of the treatment's purported benefits and worried that getting into the tank would be as much of a shock to her system as jumping into the Arctic Ocean.

But, she says, ""I would walk through fire if it would take away the pain.""

As it turned out, her treatment left her feeling briefly chilled, but it was tolerable, as if she stepped outside on a cold winter morning. She also noticed tingling in the areas of her body affected by pain, but the tingling quickly went away -- as did the pain.

""It was amazing,"" she says. ""I felt immediately better.""

She has since returned for about 40 treatments. The downside is that the treatments, ranging from $40 to $65, depending on the package, aren't covered by insurance. While she wishes the therapy were not so expensive, she thinks it's worth it.

The concept of cryotherapy is nothing new. Applying cold packs to injured joints or muscles to reduce blood flow, swelling and inflammation has long been standard practice among medical practitioners. And, as Laurusaitis said, soaking in ice baths after intense exercise is routine among professional and college athletes.

One of Laurusaitis' personal training clients, Mountain View-reared professional volleyball player Diane Copenhagen, 29, recently tried the cryotherapy tank for the first time and liked it much better than a 20- to 30-minute soak in an ice bath. ""This is an easy and fast way to help your body recover and recuperate,"" Copenhagen says.

The first cryotherapy tank was built in Japan for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The treatment spread to Europe in the 1980s and the United States in the past decade. While most users these days are professional and recreational athletes, the treatment also is used to treat symptoms of arthritis, autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders and depression.

Chiropractor Chris Watson, owner of the Peninsula Wellness Centre, also touts cryotherapy's potential for improving skin tone and helping weight loss; a single session reportedly burns anywhere from 500 to 800 calories.

The medical and scientific communities are far more reserved in their assessments, saying liquid nitrogen has been used medically for procedures such as wart removal. But so far, there is little research to show that cryotherapy offers physiological benefits, either for weight loss or for reducing muscle soreness and recovery time for athletic training.

""I remember how oxygen rooms were popping up a few years ago and a lot of athletes were using them, but the studies never really panned out,"" says Michael Fredericson, a professor of orthopedic surgery and expert in sports medicine at Stanford University Medical Center. ""I don't know if cryotherapy will end up the same way, with the therapy getting going commercially before there is really any science behind it. I'm not saying it's bad, but we don't really know.""

Joseph Costello, senior research associate in the department of sport and exercise science at the University of Portsmouth in England and one of the world's leading researchers on cryotherapy, suggests a placebo effect might be in play for some people. If anything, he says, cryotherapy offers benefits similar to cooling off skin and muscle with ice packs or ice baths, which don't cost as much.

And given that cryotherapy exposes people to extreme temperatures, he said it's imperative for more research to be done on its long-term safety.

Indeed, safety concerns arose after a 24-year-old Las Vegas spa employee was found dead in a cryotherapy chamber in October. Reports say she was using the nitrogen-filling machine alone after the center closed and died of asphyxia due to a lack of oxygen.

Cryotherapy is not regulated by the FDA or by most states, including California. The woman's death prompted Nevada health authorities to issue safety guidelines, which recommend that pregnant women or people with certain health conditions -- including high blood pressure or a history of strokes and seizures -- avoid it and that centers make sure employees are properly trained in using the machines.

Watson, of the Wellness Centre, and Stephen Evans, another co-founder of The Performist, say client safety is their No. 1 concern. New clients fill out health questionnaires and have their blood pressure checked, they say. And in contrast to the apparent practices in the Las Vegas case, an employee is always present when someone uses their chambers, they say. Of the about 1,000 people who have visited the Wellness Centre over the past year, Watson says, ""We haven't had one incident.""

To prevent potential frostbite, both centers require people to don thermal socks and gloves to protect feet and hands. They also make sure people don't go in with moist skin. Back in 2011, American sprinter Justin Gatlin said he suffered frostbite while entering a chamber wearing socks sweaty from a previous workout, according to the New York Times.

Concerns about frostbite and inconclusive information on the treatment's athletic benefits made Michael Mendenhall, 53, of Palo Alto, wary at first. But he gave it a try because he wants to compete as a master swimmer and needs to keep up a rigorous training schedule. After a week of daily sessions, he has yet to experience frostbite. Moreover, he's noticed a marked decrease in recovery time from the workouts, from one or two days to several hours. ""I just feel really good, more alert,"" he says.

While Evans agrees that more research needs to be done, he says there's enough evidence to show ""this isn't a quack thing.""

He himself hits the chamber daily to improve his training for marathons and CrossFit competitions.
