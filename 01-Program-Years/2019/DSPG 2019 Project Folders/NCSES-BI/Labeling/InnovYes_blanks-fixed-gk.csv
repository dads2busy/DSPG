7/25/19 14:11,IHPDB00020151102ebb200006,Throw,0,1,,,,,,Unsure,Approved by FDA but not scheduled to be launched,Exparel,,Unsure,Unsure,No,"Pacira's suit alleged the agency violated the Administrative Procedure Act, its own guidance and the First and Fifth Amendments by not allowing the company to promote its post-surgical analgesia product Exparel for its approved indications. The New Jersey-based drug maker filed its lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York -- the same jurisdiction that is currently working through an off-label promotion case brought against FDA by Amarin Pharma Inc. In the Amarin case, Circuit Court Judge Paul Engelmayer granted Amarin a wide-ranging preliminary injunction to promote its drug Vascepa off-label based on a 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals 2012 decision in United States v. Caronia.

A scheduling order for the case posted last week says FDA and Pacira ""have engaged in and continue to engage in settlement discussions in hopes of resolving this case or, at a minimum, narrowing the dispute,"" and gives the agency until Nov. 12 to respond to the lawsuit.

An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on the agency removing the letter from its website, saying ""it relates to matters involving pending/ongoing legislation.""

Foley & Lardner attorney David Rosen says it is rare for FDA to pull a warning letter.

""I've been working in the FDA world for about 36 years, and it doesn't happen often -- it's pretty rare,"" Rosen said. ""Pulling the warning letter doesn't mean it's rescinded, there must have been discussions with the company.""

The warning letter was the basis for Pacira filing the lawsuit.

In October 2011, FDA approved Exparel for ""administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia,"" which the drug maker contends is a broad indication. Pacira notes that in the approved labeling there are no limits on the use in any type of surgical procedure, and the only limitation is on pediatric use.

FDA granted the indication based on two representative clinical studies -- one on hemorrhoidectomy patients to study the effect of the drug on soft tissue pain, and one on bunionectomy patients to study the effect on hard-tissue/orthopedic pain. Pacira points out that FDA normally has approved analgesics with broad indications and broad dosing paradigms ""based on limited clinical studies that are understood to be representative and extrapolative."" The company also says FDA approved Exparel as effective for up to 72 hours.

In October 2014, after three years of the product's marketing and during which Pacira regularly sent FDA its promotional materials for review, the agency sent the drug maker the warning letter saying administration guides by the company and a journal advertisement are misleading and misbrand the product.

In the warning letter, FDA says the administration guides promote a use for Exparel that is not approved because they describe administration techniques for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and open colectomy,noting that only dosing regimes for hemorrhoidectomy and bunionectomy are included on the label.

Rosen says it's odd for Pacira to receive a general indication and then for FDA to say the company can only market Exparel for hemorrhoidectomy and bunionectomy.

""It's not necessarily off-label per se, unless FDA is perceiving more specific indication to be specifically off-label -- but for a pain relief pain that's kind of interesting,"" Rosen said.

Pacira complied with FDA's warning letter in order to ""minimize further disruption to its business,"" but also made several attempts to meet with the agency to discuss why the warning letter was in error. This included sending FDA a 32-page white paper in June 2015 outlining why the agency's position is ""inconsistent with scientific evidence, prior precedents, and the FDA's own regulations.""

The drug maker says it has been completely rebuffed by the FDA. In July 2015, FDA sent Pacira a close-out letter on the warning letter without any ""formal or informal"" response to the drug maker's repeated attempts at rebuttal and meeting requests, the company says. Because of this, the company says, it had no other recourse but to file suit against the agency.

Pacira contends by limiting Exparel's indications in the warning letter to hemorrhoidectomy and bunionectomy the agency is changing the rules after the fact, thereby violating the Administrative Procedure Act and the company's Fifth Amendment right to due process.

Additionally, Pacira says in the complaint that even if the claims it was making were off-label -- which the company vehemently says were not -- the 2nd Circuit's ruling in Caronia that ""the government cannot prosecute pharmaceutical manufacturers and their representatives under the FDCA for speech promoting the lawful, off-label use of an FDA approved drug"" would allow the drug maker to make the claims. -- Todd Allen Wilson (twilson@iwpnews.com)","['pacphr', 'ethold', 'ethold', 'follar', 'follar', 'pacphr', 'pacphr', 'usfda', 'usfda']",['pacphr'],Inside Washington Publishers,",usa,namz,",NAMZ USA ,"Posted: October 30, 2015 FDA recently pulled from its website an off-label promotion warning letter to Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc. that was the basis of a lawsuit against the agency, as court records indicate the two are working towards a settlement in the case filed by the company in September.

""I've been working in the FDA world for about 36 years, and it doesn't happen often -- it's pretty rare,"" Rosen said. ""Pulling the warning letter doesn't mean it's rescinded, there must have been discussions with the company.""

The warning letter was the basis for Pacira filing the lawsuit.

In October 2011, FDA approved Exparel for ""administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia,"" which the drug maker contends is a broad indication. Pacira notes that in the approved labeling there are no limits on the use in any type of surgical procedure, and the only limitation is on pediatric use.

FDA granted the indication based on two representative clinical studies -- one on hemorrhoidectomy patients to study the effect of the drug on soft tissue pain, and one on bunionectomy patients to study the effect on hard-tissue/orthopedic pain. Pacira points out that FDA normally has approved analgesics with broad indications and broad dosing paradigms ""based on limited clinical studies that are understood to be representative and extrapolative."" The company also says FDA approved Exparel as effective for up to 72 hours.

In October 2014, after three years of the product's marketing and during which Pacira regularly sent FDA its promotional materials for review, the agency sent the drug maker the warning letter saying administration guides by the company and a journal advertisement are misleading and misbrand the product.

In the warning letter, FDA says the administration guides promote a use for Exparel that is not approved because they describe administration techniques for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and open colectomy,noting that only dosing regimes for hemorrhoidectomy and bunionectomy are included on the label.

Rosen says it's odd for Pacira to receive a general indication and then for FDA to say the company can only market Exparel for hemorrhoidectomy and bunionectomy.

""It's not necessarily off-label per se, unless FDA is perceiving more specific indication to be specifically off-label -- but for a pain relief pain that's kind of interesting,"" Rosen said.

Pacira complied with FDA's warning letter in order to ""minimize further disruption to its business,"" but also made several attempts to meet with the agency to discuss why the warning letter was in error. This included sending FDA a 32-page white paper in June 2015 outlining why the agency's position is ""inconsistent with scientific evidence, prior precedents, and the FDA's own regulations.""

The drug maker says it has been completely rebuffed by the FDA. In July 2015, FDA sent Pacira a close-out letter on the warning letter without any ""formal or informal"" response to the drug maker's repeated attempts at rebuttal and meeting requests, the company says. Because of this, the company says, it had no other recourse but to file suit against the agency.

Pacira contends by limiting Exparel's indications in the warning letter to hemorrhoidectomy and bunionectomy the agency is changing the rules after the fact, thereby violating the Administrative Procedure Act and the company's Fifth Amendment right to due process.

Additionally, Pacira says in the complaint that even if the claims it was making were off-label -- which the company vehemently says were not -- the 2nd Circuit's ruling in Caronia that ""the government cannot prosecute pharmaceutical manufacturers and their representatives under the FDCA for speech promoting the lawful, off-label use of an FDA approved drug"" would allow the drug maker to make the claims. -- Todd Allen Wilson (twilson@iwpnews.com)",881

Typical formulations for oral administration include liquid solutions, emulsions, or suspensions, as well as solid forms such as capsules or tablets. Solid oral dosage formulations are usually intended for adults who can easily swallow large tablets whole, the often disagreeable taste of the active ingredient need not be taken into account in formulating the medicine, except for the provision of means to prevent the taste from being apparent during the short time that the medicine is in the mouth. Such means may include the provision of an appropriate coating on the tablet, the use of a capsule form (the gelatin outer shell of the capsule keeps the active ingredient inside until the capsule has been swallowed), or simply firmly compressing a tablet so that it will not begin to disintegrate during the short time that it is intended to be in the mouth.

""Children, older persons, and many other persons have difficulty swallowing whole tablets and even capsules. Therefore, it is often desirable to provide the medicine either in liquid form or in a chewable solid form or an alternative solid form, e.g., small particles which can be sprinkled onto soft food and swallowed intact with the food, in addition to the tablet or capsule intended to be swallowed whole. A oral liquid dosage form has many advantages for pediatric patients and for elderly patients. Many medicines have bitter or an otherwise disagreeable taste and this can be a significant problem. A further requirement of any dosage form is that it must be bioavailable; that is, once the formulation reaches the stomach, the formulation should release the active ingredient rapidly and completely to ensure that substantially the entire amount of the active ingredient is absorbed.

""For some medicines the limited solubility of the drug in water can be a problem in formulation liquid oral dosage forms and in this case a suspension is often used. However, a suspension can present it's own type of problem if the drug has some solubility in water the tiny particles held in an aqueous suspension can change in crystal form or size. This can present problems in maintaining proper bioavailability either because crystal size can affect absorption rate or because the re-crystallization process can alter the polymorphic form of the suspended crystals and the altered form may have a different bioavailability. Thus there is a need for a suspension formulation that reduces the rate of re-crystallization and/or change in polymorphic form of a slightly soluble crystalline compound such as carisbamate.""

""In another aspect is a method of formulating such a suspension comprising: (a) preparing one solution by dissolving the sodium benzoate in approximately 30% of the total water volume at room temperature 22 C; (b) adding the citric acid, the sucralose and the raspberry flavor with mixing; (c) preparing a second solution dispersing the hypromellose (HPMC) and the carisbamate in approximately 70% of the total water volume at 22 C with mixing; (d) adding the first solution to the second while mixing to form the stabilized suspension and (e) adding the citric acid monohydrate to adjust the pH of the final formulation to between pH 3.5 and 4.5 preferably with a target pH of 4.0.

The general study design is a randomized controlled clinical trial that includes two key objectives: first, to demonstrate contribution of each agent in the TG-1101 + TGR-1202 regimen (the combination sometimes referred to as ""1303""), and second, to demonstrate superiority in Progression Free Survival (PFS) over the standard of care to support the submission for full approval of the combination. The study will randomize patients into four treatment arms: TG-1101 + TGR-1202, TG-1101 alone, TGR-1202 alone, and an active control arm of obinutuzumab + chlorambucil. An early interim analysis will assess contribution of each single agent in the TG-1101 + TGR-1202 combination regimen, which, if successful, will allow early termination of both single agent arms. A second interim analysis will be conducted following full enrollment into the study, which, if positive, the Company plans to utilize for accelerated approval. Assuming early termination of the TG-1101 and TGR-1202 single agent arms, the study will enroll approximately 450 patients.

Dr. John Gribben, Professor of Medicine and the Gordon Hamilton Fairley Chair of Medical Oncology at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Cancer Institute in London, UK, will lead the UNITY-CLL Phase 3 as Study Chair. Dr. Gribben commented, ""The recent introduction of novel targeted agents has already dramatically improved the standard of care for patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, and we have seen even greater activity when these agents are used in combination. Both ublituximab and TGR-1202 have demonstrated unique activity and tolerability as single agents, and in combination together. We are excited to lead this important and innovative trial, which has the potential to bring greater advances to patients in both the front-line and relapsed/refractory CLL setting.""

Michael S. Weiss, Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of TG Therapeutics, stated, ""Our number one goal has always been to accelerate the development of novel non-chemotherapy-based combination treatments for patients with B-cell malignancies. The UNITY-CLL study and the related SPA marks a major milestone for the Company and, if successful, could lead to a very broad label in the treatment of CLL, providing patients and physicians a new treatment option, and the Company a platform to build additional proprietary combinations in our continued effort to drive towards a cure. Our path to achieving this SPA, which we believe is the first for two novel investigational agents in the oncology division, was the result of a true collaboration with the FDA, for which we would like to recognize and thank the agency for its invaluable guidance throughout this process."" Mr. Weiss continued, ""Our clinical team has been hard at work preparing for the launch of this study, and we look forward to enrolling our first patients as soon as possible. Lastly, we are thrilled to have Dr. Gribben, a world-renowned authority in CLL, lead this important international study and share in his excitement in bringing our novel, non-chemotherapy combination regimen to patients in need.""

ABOUT TG THERAPEUTICS, INC.

TG Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Currently, the Company is developing two therapies targeting hematological malignancies. TG-1101 (ublituximab) is a novel, glycoengineered monoclonal antibody that targets a specific and unique epitope on the CD20 antigen found on mature B-lymphocytes. TG Therapeutics is also developing TGR-1202, an orally available PI3K delta inhibitor. The delta isoform of PI3K is strongly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin and is believed to be important in the proliferation and survival of B?lymphocytes. Both TG-1101 and TGR-1202 are in clinical development for patients with hematologic malignancies. The Company also has pre-clinical programs to develop IRAK4 inhibitors, and anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies. TG Therapeutics is headquartered in New York City.

About Special Protocol Assessments

The Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for a new drug application.

Final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 clinical program. The SPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product efficacy or safety. For more information on Special Protocol Assessment, please visit: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080571.pdf.

Cautionary Statement

Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those with respect to anticipating future clinical trials, the timing of commencing or completing such trials and business prospects for TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program, and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies may be forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are the following: our ability to successfully and cost-effectively complete pre-clinical and clinical trials for TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies; the risk that early pre-clinical and clinical results that supported our decision to move forward with TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies will not be reproduced in additional patients or in future studies; the risk that trends observed which underlie certain assumptions of future performance of TGR-1202 will not continue, the risk that TGR-1202 will not produce satisfactory safety and efficacy results to warrant further development following the completion of the current Phase 1 study; the risk that the data (both safety and efficacy) from future clinical trials will not coincide with the data produced from prior pre-clinical and clinical trials; the risk that trials will take longer to enroll than expected; our ability to achieve the milestones we project over the next year; our ability to manage our cash in line with our projections, and other risk factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any forward-looking statements set forth in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release.

The general study design is a randomized controlled clinical trial that includes two key objectives: first, to demonstrate contribution of each agent in the TG-1101 + TGR-1202 regimen (the combination sometimes referred to as ""1303""), and second, to demonstrate superiority in Progression Free Survival (PFS) over the standard of care to support the submission for full approval of the combination. The study will randomize patients into four treatment arms: TG-1101 + TGR-1202, TG-1101 alone, TGR-1202 alone, and an active control arm of obinutuzumab + chlorambucil. An early interim analysis will assess contribution of each single agent in the TG-1101 + TGR-1202 combination regimen, which, if successful, will allow early termination of both single agent arms. A second interim analysis will be conducted following full enrollment into the study, which, if positive, the Company plans to utilize for accelerated approval. Assuming early termination of the TG-1101 and TGR-1202 single agent arms, the study will enroll approximately 450 patients.

Dr. John Gribben, Professor of Medicine and the Gordon Hamilton Fairley Chair of Medical Oncology at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Cancer Institute in London, UK, will lead the UNITY-CLL Phase 3 as Study Chair. Dr. Gribben commented, ""The recent introduction of novel targeted agents has already dramatically improved the standard of care for patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, and we have seen even greater activity when these agents are used in combination. Both ublituximab and TGR-1202 have demonstrated unique activity and tolerability as single agents, and in combination together. We are excited to lead this important and innovative trial, which has the potential to bring greater advances to patients in both the front-line and relapsed/refractory CLL setting.""

Michael S. Weiss, Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of TG Therapeutics, stated, ""Our number one goal has always been to accelerate the development of novel non-chemotherapy-based combination treatments for patients with B-cell malignancies. The UNITY-CLL study and the related SPA marks a major milestone for the Company and, if successful, could lead to a very broad label in the treatment of CLL, providing patients and physicians a new treatment option, and the Company a platform to build additional proprietary combinations in our continued effort to drive towards a cure. Our path to achieving this SPA, which we believe is the first for two novel investigational agents in the oncology division, was the result of a true collaboration with the FDA, for which we would like to recognize and thank the agency for its invaluable guidance throughout this process."" Mr. Weiss continued, ""Our clinical team has been hard at work preparing for the launch of this study, and we look forward to enrolling our first patients as soon as possible. Lastly, we are thrilled to have Dr. Gribben, a world-renowned authority in CLL, lead this important international study and share in his excitement in bringing our novel, non-chemotherapy combination regimen to patients in need.""

ABOUT TG THERAPEUTICS, INC.

TG Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases.

Both TG-1101 and TGR-1202 are in clinical development for patients with hematologic malignancies. The Company also has pre-clinical programs to develop IRAK4 inhibitors, and anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies. TG Therapeutics is headquartered in New York City.

About Special Protocol Assessments

The Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for a new drug application.

Final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 clinical program. The SPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product efficacy or safety.

Cautionary Statement

Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those with respect to anticipating future clinical trials, the timing of commencing or completing such trials and business prospects for TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program, and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies may be forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are the following: our ability to successfully and cost-effectively complete pre-clinical and clinical trials for TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies; the risk that early pre-clinical and clinical results that supported our decision to move forward with TG-1101, TGR-1202, the IRAK4 inhibitor program and the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies will not be reproduced in additional patients or in future studies; the risk that trends observed which underlie certain assumptions of future performance of TGR-1202 will not continue, the risk that TGR-1202 will not produce satisfactory safety and efficacy results to warrant further development following the completion of the current Phase 1 study; the risk that the data (both safety and efficacy) from future clinical trials will not coincide with the data produced from prior pre-clinical and clinical trials; the risk that trials will take longer to enroll than expected; our ability to achieve the milestones we project over the next year; our ability to manage our cash in line with our projections, and other risk factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any forward-looking statements set forth in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release.

No. 11/570,983, filed Jun. 23, 2005, and incorporated by reference in its entirety herein) has the structure of Formula I:

""##STR00001## The compound of Formula I is a protein kinase inhibitor and is useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases mediated by protein kinases. In particular, the compound of Formula I inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, KDR, HER1, HER2, Bcr-Abl, Tie2, and Ret kinases. It is therefore useful in the treatment of cancers including AML, melanocytic neoplasia, breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer (especially small-cell lung cancer), cancer of the prostate or Kaposi's sarcoma.

""It is well known that the crystalline form of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of a particular drug is often an important determinant of the drug's ease of preparation, hygroscopicity, stability, solubility, storage stability, ease of formulation, rate of dissolution in gastrointestinal fluids and in vivo bioavailability. Crystalline forms occur where the same composition of matter crystallizes in a different lattice arrangement resulting in different thermodynamic properties and stabilities specific to the particular crystalline form. Crystalline forms may also include different hydrates or solvates of the same compound. In deciding which form is preferable, the numerous properties of the forms are compared and the preferred form chosen based on the many physical property variables. It is entirely possible that one form can be preferable in some circumstances where certain aspects such as ease of preparation, stability, etc. are deemed to be critical. In other situations, a different form may be preferred for greater dissolution rate and/or superior bioavailability. It is not yet possible to predict whether a particular compound or salt of a compound will form polymorphs, whether any such polymorphs will be suitable for commercial use in a therapeutic composition, or which polymorphs will display such desirable properties.""

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""There are provided herein crystal and amorphous forms of the compound of Formula I, compositions including the crystal and amorphous forms, and methods of preparing the crystal and amorphous forms and compositions. The present technology further provides methods of using the crystal or amorphous forms of compounds of Formula I and compositions thereof to treat various diseases, including but not limited to, those that can be prevented, inhibited or ameliorated by inhibition of kinase activity selected from FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, KDR, HER1, HER2, Bcr-Abl, Tie2, and Ret kinases.""

The research, led by Professor Matt Cooper and Dr Johannes Zuegg from UQ's Institute for Molecular Bioscience (IMB) in partnership with Alchemia, was published in scientific journal Nature Communications.

Professor Cooper, Director of the IMB Centre for Superbug Solutions, said bacteria are less likely to become resistant to an antibiotic based on a modified version of their own sugar.

""Bacteria have cell walls similar to the walls of a brick house, except instead of mortar the walls are held together by sugar polymers,"" Professor Cooper said.

""But if you add one of our modified sugar molecules, they stop the linking process, destroying the cell wall and killing the bacteria.""

""The cell wall has been a target for antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin before, but the difference here is that we are stopping a centrally important part of the cell wall linking process.""

Dr Zuegg said the team examined hundreds of versions of Alchemia's modified sugar molecules to find those that will kill bacteria and are non-toxic to human cells.

""Most molecules screened to become drugs have a flat, planar shape, whereas these molecules are three dimensional,"" Dr Zuegg said.

""This means we can build on the sugar core in a variety of ways to make thousands of different combinations in three dimensional space.
